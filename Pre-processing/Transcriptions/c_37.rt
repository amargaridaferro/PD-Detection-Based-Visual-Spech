00:00:08.620 00:00:10.380
I'm dr. Rachel Dolan a movement disorder

00:00:11.140 00:00:12.060
specialists and vice president of

00:00:12.220 00:00:13.740
medical communications at the Michael J

00:00:13.780 00:00:15.230
Fox foundation for Parkinson's research

00:00:16.240 00:00:17.519
today I'll be talking about cognitive

00:00:18.010 00:00:19.250
dysfunction and Parkinson's disease

00:00:20.260 00:00:21.450
cognitive dysfunction is a non motor

00:00:21.850 00:00:23.010
symptoms that can be associated with

00:00:23.260 00:00:24.270
Parkinson's disease

00:00:24.640 00:00:26.220
it refers to an impairment of memory

00:00:27.070 00:00:29.250
and/or thinking abilities it can occur

00:00:29.350 00:00:31.320
at any stage in Parkinson's disease and

00:00:31.600 00:00:33.810
range from mild to more severe if

00:00:34.690 00:00:35.970
significant problems happen they're more

00:00:36.220 00:00:37.680
likely to occur in the later stages of

00:00:38.130 00:00:39.690
disease cognitive problems in

00:00:40.270 00:00:41.400
Parkinson's typically involve what we

00:00:41.620 00:00:43.920
call executive function so this includes

00:00:44.590 00:00:45.920
activities like multitasking

00:00:46.930 00:00:48.690
problem-solving planning or organizing

00:00:49.630 00:00:50.850
some people will also have difficulty

00:00:51.160 00:00:52.889
with concentrating or finding their

00:00:53.170 00:00:54.990
words when speaking and others will

00:00:55.450 00:01:01.730
experience short-term memory loss

00:01:01.800 00:01:03.680
if cognitive problems arise in

00:01:04.260 00:01:05.420
Parkinson's disease doctors will

00:01:05.820 00:01:06.800
typically perform an evaluation

00:01:07.410 00:01:09.530
including brain imaging and blood tests

00:01:09.870 00:01:11.270
to exclude other conditions that can

00:01:11.340 00:01:13.700
affect a memory and thinking examples of

00:01:13.800 00:01:15.560
these would be low thyroid or vitamin

00:01:15.990 00:01:18.500
b12 deficiency they'll also probably ask

00:01:18.810 00:01:20.690
about depression and sleep problems as

00:01:21.000 00:01:22.580
these two can impact memory and thinking

00:01:22.950 00:01:25.100
in some cases they'll order formal

00:01:25.650 00:01:27.050
detailed memory testing called

00:01:27.660 00:01:29.450
neuropsychological testing which can

00:01:29.580 00:01:31.460
help determine where and what problems

00:01:31.590 00:01:33.320
are happening as well as establish a

00:01:33.720 00:01:40.250
baseline for future comparison

00:01:41.130 00:01:42.560
cognitive dysfunction and Parkinson's

00:01:43.020 00:01:44.360
likely occurs due to a combination of

00:01:44.520 00:01:46.780
both chemical and structural changes

00:01:47.790 00:01:48.470
Parkinson's can affect the brain

00:01:49.140 00:01:50.150
chemicals that are responsible for

00:01:50.700 00:01:52.760
memory and thinking abilities as well as

00:01:53.220 00:01:54.470
damaged brain cells in areas that are

00:01:55.050 00:02:00.980
responsible for these functions

00:02:01.049 00:02:03.530
if memory and thinking problems are out

00:02:03.570 00:02:05.210
of proportion to what could be expected

00:02:05.460 00:02:07.670
with normal aging but they aren't severe

00:02:07.920 00:02:09.469
enough to impact a person's ability to

00:02:09.750 00:02:12.350
work function and daily life or interact

00:02:12.480 00:02:14.479
in social situations they may be

00:02:15.030 00:02:16.270
diagnosed as mild cognitive impairment

00:02:17.280 00:02:18.740
there aren't currently any medications

00:02:18.989 00:02:21.199
to treat mild cognitive impairment so

00:02:21.569 00:02:22.640
doctors will recommend adaptive

00:02:23.190 00:02:24.949
strategies like keeping notes or relying

00:02:25.080 00:02:27.380
on a calendar it's also important to

00:02:27.840 00:02:30.020
exercise regularly interact with others

00:02:30.239 00:02:32.390
in social situations and do brain

00:02:33.000 00:02:35.449
activities you can read do crossword

00:02:35.880 00:02:38.120
puzzles play cards even pick up a new

00:02:38.160 00:02:40.190
hobby like learning a new language or

00:02:40.470 00:02:46.420
playing a new instrument

00:02:47.150 00:02:48.789
mild cognitive impairment doesn't always

00:02:49.220 00:02:49.780
get worse

00:02:50.239 00:02:51.309
but when memory and thinking problems

00:02:52.010 00:02:53.800
are significant enough to impact a

00:02:54.140 00:02:56.319
person's ability to work do their daily

00:02:56.810 00:02:58.690
activities at home or interact in social

00:02:58.879 00:03:00.910
situations it might be diagnosed as

00:03:01.569 00:03:03.009
dementia dementia and Parkinson's

00:03:03.980 00:03:05.440
disease is treated with medications that

00:03:05.720 00:03:07.630
work on the acetylcholine brain chemical

00:03:08.120 00:03:09.819
pathway an example of this would be

00:03:10.489 00:03:12.099
exelon or rivastigmine which is

00:03:12.620 00:03:13.780
fda-approved to treat Parkinson's

00:03:14.659 00:03:17.319
disease dementia in some cases doctors

00:03:17.659 00:03:19.690
will also prescribe medications used for

00:03:20.299 00:03:21.970
Alzheimer's dementia an example of this

00:03:22.190 00:03:29.210
would be Aris after genetical

00:03:30.060 00:03:31.070
researchers are looking to determine

00:03:31.780 00:03:33.479
why cognitive dysfunction happens in

00:03:34.090 00:03:35.880
Parkinson's disease and at the same time

00:03:36.400 00:03:37.440
they're looking for better ways to

00:03:37.989 00:03:39.780
diagnose monitor and treat these

00:03:40.620 00:03:42.149
conditions current trials are

00:03:42.819 00:03:43.850
investigating physical therapy

00:03:44.860 00:03:46.649
medications aerobic exercise and

00:03:47.500 00:03:49.170
cognitive rehabilitation which is

00:03:49.540 00:03:50.789
basically like physical therapy for the

00:03:51.040 00:03:52.920
brain you can learn more about this and
