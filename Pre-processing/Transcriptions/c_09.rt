00:00:01.890 00:00:03.949
hello and welcome to white coat medicine

00:00:04.170 00:00:06.559
talks my name is Patsy speech and

00:00:06.690 00:00:09.169
language pathologist in the last video

00:00:09.719 00:00:11.330
we talked about Parkinson's disease and

00:00:11.730 00:00:14.060
the very common type of speech pattern

00:00:14.580 00:00:17.300
errors that an individual living with

00:00:17.490 00:00:19.910
Parkinson's often deals with in today's

00:00:20.160 00:00:22.820
video let's talk about another challenge

00:00:23.340 00:00:25.130
that is often faced by individuals

00:00:25.619 00:00:27.859
living with Parkinson's this is a

00:00:28.439 00:00:31.700
swallowing disorder called dysphasia no

00:00:32.160 00:00:34.040
longer are the muscles of the throat the

00:00:34.460 00:00:36.440
same because of the nature of the

00:00:37.260 00:00:38.930
Parkinson's disease this overall

00:00:39.809 00:00:41.630
generalized weakness also affects the

00:00:41.910 00:00:44.060
throat muscles and they no longer work

00:00:44.250 00:00:46.869
the same so it's important to take

00:00:47.879 00:00:49.250
precaution let's talk about five

00:00:49.890 00:00:51.290
swallowing precautions that will help

00:00:51.570 00:00:54.740
you or a loved one to swallow safely

00:00:55.680 00:00:58.819
number one take small sips and small

00:01:00.359 00:01:02.209
remember the muscles of the throat are

00:01:02.430 00:01:04.070
no longer working the same they don't

00:01:04.260 00:01:06.830
have the same strength nor do they have

00:01:07.110 00:01:10.730
the same speed therefore taking smaller

00:01:11.220 00:01:12.050
amounts of food in your mouth

00:01:12.560 00:01:15.920
is safer take small sips take small

00:01:16.110 00:01:19.910
bites number two always take your time

00:01:20.280 00:01:23.149
while eating and don't talk while you're

00:01:23.840 00:01:26.929
eating when you speak you take a breath

00:01:27.299 00:01:29.899
and you open your airway opening the

00:01:30.320 00:01:32.539
airway gives you a higher risk of

00:01:33.420 00:01:35.749
aspirating and chopping so take your

00:01:36.060 00:01:38.030
time while you're eating and drinking

00:01:38.549 00:01:41.359
and don't talk wait till you safely

00:01:41.790 00:01:43.789
swallow and then engage in conversation

00:01:44.640 00:01:47.810
this will help you swallow safely number

00:01:48.180 00:01:50.560
three you want to alternate between

00:01:51.570 00:01:55.580
solids and liquids so take a bite chew

00:01:55.890 00:01:58.999
nice and slow swallow then take a sip

00:01:59.689 00:02:02.690
and that'll make sure that'll clean out

00:02:02.880 00:02:05.749
your mouth and any residue anything left

00:02:05.939 00:02:06.260
in the

00:02:06.750 00:02:09.050
cavity in your mouth will also be taken

00:02:09.179 00:02:11.210
down with the liquid and you can ensure

00:02:11.610 00:02:13.370
that everything is cleared out of your

00:02:13.620 00:02:15.860
mouth then take another small bite

00:02:16.260 00:02:18.220
so alternate between solids and liquids

00:02:19.230 00:02:21.320
well also ensure that you're swallowing

00:02:23.330 00:02:25.790
safely posture number four very

00:02:27.230 00:02:30.680
important posture will keep you eating

00:02:31.290 00:02:35.030
safely so remember to sit straight if

00:02:35.580 00:02:37.970
you can sit at a chair on the table

00:02:38.819 00:02:42.830
there by the table and look for a 90

00:02:43.140 00:02:44.150
degree angle where you're sitting

00:02:44.880 00:02:48.170
upright and your neck is upright you

00:02:48.390 00:02:50.690
never want to look up and try to swallow

00:02:51.090 00:02:53.680
this way this opens up your airway and

00:02:54.690 00:02:57.500
runs you run the risk of aspirating this

00:02:57.690 00:02:59.420
way many people sometimes think oh well

00:02:59.519 00:03:03.140
if I do this gravity will help and I can

00:03:03.920 00:03:05.509
swallow everything that's in my mouth

00:03:06.209 00:03:08.690
that's not true it's safer if you engage

00:03:09.060 00:03:12.050
in a chin tuck so do this and swallow

00:03:12.390 00:03:15.259
this way this covers the airway and

00:03:16.140 00:03:19.699
protects you from aspirating so posture

00:03:19.920 00:03:23.990
very important and number five always

00:03:24.269 00:03:26.120
wait a minimum of 30 minutes before

00:03:26.549 00:03:28.729
laying down after eating a meal or

00:03:29.400 00:03:32.830
drinking a glass of water 30 minutes at

00:03:33.840 00:03:35.870
minimum you want to be able to wait to

00:03:36.269 00:03:37.370
ensure that everything is cleared out of

00:03:37.500 00:03:40.610
your mouth that digestion begins and

00:03:41.519 00:03:43.819
that everything is clear so that when

00:03:43.980 00:03:46.009
you lie down there's nothing in your

00:03:46.290 00:03:48.259
mouth that you may run the risk of it

00:03:48.690 00:03:50.900
going back into your throat and possibly

00:03:51.840 00:03:55.160
leading to aspiration or choking so

00:03:55.319 00:03:56.180
those are the five swallowing

00:03:56.819 00:03:59.650
precautions that can help you swallow

00:04:00.660 00:04:02.960
safely I hope this has helped you or a

00:04:03.359 00:04:07.040
loved one until next time
