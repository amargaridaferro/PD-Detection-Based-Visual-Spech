00:00:00.539 00:00:02.149
when you're diagnosed with Parkinson's

00:00:02.340 00:00:03.530
the big question everybody asks is

00:00:03.750 00:00:05.059
what's causing this and I think that's a

00:00:05.190 00:00:06.680
great question even though we know there

00:00:06.839 00:00:08.330
can be genetic factors if you do some

00:00:08.790 00:00:10.070
testing there's definitely genetic

00:00:10.380 00:00:12.650
causes there also can be genomic factors

00:00:12.809 00:00:14.030
around genetics that are making things

00:00:14.340 00:00:15.890
worse you know impacting the symptoms

00:00:16.020 00:00:17.599
that the patient is dealing with I just

00:00:17.789 00:00:19.849
want to encourage you as a patient to

00:00:20.250 00:00:22.910
really get a more in-depth diagnosis is

00:00:23.130 00:00:24.349
there infectious disease as there

00:00:25.019 00:00:26.570
neurotoxicity is their chemical heavy

00:00:26.910 00:00:29.029
metal toxins etc when you know those

00:00:29.340 00:00:30.740
things I believe from an area of

00:00:31.529 00:00:32.950
personalized and functional medicine and

00:00:33.960 00:00:35.090
integrative medicine can you improve the

00:00:35.309 00:00:37.030
quality of life now I'm not saying that

00:00:38.040 00:00:39.500
this approach works for everyone but for

00:00:39.840 00:00:41.420
some patients it really can make a big

00:00:41.460 00:00:43.459
difference and we've seen that in our

00:00:43.920 00:00:45.619
clinical practice I want to wish you the

00:00:45.750 00:00:47.299
best on your journey to healing and may
