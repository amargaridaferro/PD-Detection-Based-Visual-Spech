00:00:00.539 00:00:01.850
fatigue is the name given to an

00:00:02.159 00:00:04.190
overwhelming sense of tiredness and lack

00:00:04.230 00:00:07.130
of energy it can be a physical mental or

00:00:07.410 00:00:09.589
emotional feeling that makes everyday

00:00:10.260 00:00:12.470
activities much harder to complete it's

00:00:12.690 00:00:14.870
worth noting that feeling fatigue is

00:00:15.509 00:00:17.090
different to feeling sleepy when you're

00:00:17.550 00:00:19.580
fatigued your muscles have basically

00:00:20.100 00:00:21.410
completely run out of power they're at

00:00:21.949 00:00:23.779
rock-bottom whereas when you're sleepy

00:00:24.300 00:00:25.970
it's just like they kind of need a break

00:00:26.340 00:00:28.009
and although people experiencing fatigue

00:00:28.650 00:00:30.769
do need to sleep and rest when they do

00:00:31.289 00:00:33.139
it doesn't necessarily reduce the amount

00:00:33.239 00:00:35.630
of fatigue that they're feeling so what

00:00:35.880 00:00:38.150
does cause fatigue in Parkinson's well

00:00:38.340 00:00:40.580
it's kind of complicated and that's an

00:00:41.550 00:00:47.630
so let me explain you see there's been

00:00:47.850 00:00:50.180
questions about whether fatigue is its

00:00:50.460 00:00:52.220
only symptom caused by its own

00:00:52.920 00:00:54.979
mechanisms a standalone if you will or

00:00:55.379 00:00:57.470
if it's simply results of numerous other

00:00:58.050 00:01:00.170
symptoms for example our muscles could

00:01:00.359 00:01:02.450
get fatigued because they need to work

00:01:03.059 00:01:08.750
harder due to Trenor or our muscles

00:01:08.939 00:01:10.700
could get fatigued because they need to

00:01:10.920 00:01:13.359
work for longer periods of time due to

00:01:17.060 00:01:19.370
slowness emotional fatigue could arise

00:01:19.770 00:01:24.310
as a result of parkinsonian depression

00:01:25.100 00:01:28.090
and mental fatigue could stem from sleep

00:01:31.300 00:01:33.730
disturbances or it could be a result of

00:01:37.000 00:01:40.150
apathy and as you can see we end up with

00:01:40.310 00:01:42.100
this big jumble of different symptoms

00:01:42.890 00:01:44.590
with fatigue trapped somewhere in the

00:01:44.930 00:01:47.830
middle and us left unsure exactly how to

00:01:48.290 00:01:49.850
isolate it

00:01:53.160 00:01:54.890
you see we've got a fair bit of untying

00:01:55.170 00:01:57.290
to do before we can fully understand

00:01:57.750 00:01:59.300
fatigue but that isn't stopping

00:02:00.210 00:02:01.790
researchers from still trying to find a

00:02:02.220 00:02:04.070
treatment and I've got two examples of

00:02:04.470 00:02:06.530
studies that are attempting to do just

00:02:06.780 00:02:08.840
that wall roof of researchers thinks a

00:02:09.330 00:02:10.609
potential treatment could be right under

00:02:10.950 00:02:12.560
our noses they're investigating the

00:02:12.900 00:02:15.260
effect of versace lean on fatigue now

00:02:15.750 00:02:18.170
research lean is already used to treat

00:02:18.390 00:02:19.910
other Parkinson's symptoms such as

00:02:20.430 00:02:22.820
tremor but when patients take it they

00:02:23.130 00:02:25.730
also report an increase in energy levels

00:02:26.010 00:02:27.980
and so it's thought it could also work

00:02:28.650 00:02:30.560
against fatigue my other example of some

00:02:30.870 00:02:32.240
research going on at the moment comes

00:02:32.550 00:02:34.430
from the New York School of Medicine and

00:02:35.160 00:02:37.280
as of August 2017 they were actually

00:02:37.920 00:02:39.710
recruiting four participants so if

00:02:39.870 00:02:41.870
you're in the area hit them up they're

00:02:42.600 00:02:45.020
investigating the effect of remotely

00:02:45.630 00:02:47.210
supervised transcranial direct current

00:02:47.990 00:02:51.980
stimulation catchy or tDCS on fatigue

00:02:52.950 00:02:55.280
tDCS is a non-invasive brain stimulation

00:02:56.040 00:02:58.220
technique in other words we can use it

00:02:58.380 00:03:00.620
to change our brain activity while still

00:03:00.870 00:03:03.949
keeping our skull in one piece now this

00:03:04.080 00:03:05.540
is quite an interesting study because

00:03:06.360 00:03:07.940
people are going to be trained up to use

00:03:08.130 00:03:10.580
this method but then sent off to have a

00:03:10.800 00:03:13.070
go at it in their own homes whilst a

00:03:13.519 00:03:15.500
technician supervisors from Oatley the

00:03:15.720 00:03:17.270
study hopes that if we can activate

00:03:17.610 00:03:19.940
brain areas related to fatigue then we

00:03:20.160 00:03:21.979
can reduce it so those are just a couple

00:03:22.290 00:03:23.840
of examples of the current research

00:03:24.390 00:03:26.420
projects going on but hopefully with the

00:03:26.610 00:03:28.790
help of willing volunteers we can untie

00:03:29.220 00:03:31.970
fatigue and find a treatment that's all

00:03:32.160 00:03:33.830
for now I hope it's been helpful and

00:03:34.140 00:03:35.690
