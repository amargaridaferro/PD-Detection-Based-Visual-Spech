00:00:05.900 00:00:07.480
hey Parkinson's warriors in this video

00:00:07.580 00:00:09.250
we're going to talk about the benefits

00:00:09.380 00:00:12.430
of CBD for Parkinson's so CBD is a type

00:00:12.469 00:00:14.200
of marijuana and when people hear

00:00:14.630 00:00:16.450
marijuana instantly you know how sirens

00:00:16.580 00:00:19.269
go off oh it's a you know the back drug

00:00:19.730 00:00:21.730
reefer madness you get high you know

00:00:21.890 00:00:23.859
your stoner your teenager your skater

00:00:24.290 00:00:26.019
whatever the stereotypes are that people

00:00:26.239 00:00:28.540
think about this is not what this is so

00:00:29.119 00:00:32.770
there are two types of chemicals at work

00:00:33.050 00:00:36.490
in marijuana so there's a THC which is

00:00:36.649 00:00:38.139
the psychoactive ingredient the one that

00:00:38.300 00:00:39.790
makes you high and makes your eyes go

00:00:39.980 00:00:41.860
red and like you know your your mouth is

00:00:42.079 00:00:45.130
dry and you have a head high and you're

00:00:45.829 00:00:47.169
maybe Huson aiding or having anxiety

00:00:47.480 00:00:49.599
attacks those kinds can happen with THC

00:00:50.510 00:00:51.610
that's not what we're talking about here

00:00:52.039 00:00:54.459
we're talking about CBD cabinets that

00:00:54.829 00:00:56.650
are contained inside the marijuana plant

00:00:56.989 00:00:58.119
I don't have any psychoactive

00:00:58.789 00:01:00.430
ingredients in fact you can take cab

00:01:00.969 00:01:03.639
annoyed and not get high at all so your

00:01:03.769 00:01:05.710
eyes won't go red you won't be impaired

00:01:05.870 00:01:09.270
in any way it doesn't cause any kind of

00:01:10.280 00:01:12.070
hallucinations or anxiety attacks or any

00:01:12.260 00:01:13.240
of those things you associated with

00:01:13.460 00:01:15.160
being high two ways you can really get a

00:01:15.880 00:01:20.470
CBD there is the capsule form which is

00:01:20.810 00:01:23.560
right here capsules of CBD and this is

00:01:23.720 00:01:25.870
that two and a half percent so that

00:01:26.150 00:01:28.840
means is that it's two half percent CBD

00:01:29.180 00:01:30.840
and the rest of what is that ninety

00:01:31.850 00:01:34.300
seven and a half percent is the oils

00:01:34.610 00:01:36.160
that they used to mix in with the CBD so

00:01:37.070 00:01:38.200
I'll show you what a capsule looks like

00:01:38.330 00:01:40.420
they just looks literally like it's a

00:01:40.610 00:01:42.880
capsule oil like a omega-3 or something

00:01:43.490 00:01:46.660
so that's a capsule of CBD oil and you

00:01:46.850 00:01:51.880
can take this however your neurologist

00:01:52.130 00:01:54.490
or doctor or naturopath and stretch you

00:01:54.770 00:01:56.650
you know whether it's like one capsule a

00:01:56.750 00:01:59.980
day two capsules a day two capsules

00:02:00.680 00:02:03.220
twice a day you know depending on you

00:02:03.290 00:02:04.750
know what you want to treat to nap

00:02:05.240 00:02:06.460
percent is the lowest you can get you

00:02:06.590 00:02:09.400
can get 5% get 10% so it goes up in

00:02:09.739 00:02:11.890
strength so it could be useful to check

00:02:12.019 00:02:13.510
that out as well the other way you can

00:02:13.700 00:02:16.150
get Kevin Owens and or CBD is in a

00:02:16.970 00:02:17.710
dropper form

00:02:17.930 00:02:19.570
so this is just liquid can basically

00:02:19.700 00:02:23.490
what you do here is you just unscrew it

00:02:24.500 00:02:27.640
get a little bit of liquid that's it

00:02:27.770 00:02:30.610
right there see that he's put on your

00:02:30.830 00:02:33.670
tongue a couple drops and has the same

00:02:34.040 00:02:36.600
effect that it's having one of those

00:02:37.610 00:02:39.940
capsules so this is just another form

00:02:40.940 00:02:42.220
maybe still easier if you have trouble

00:02:42.340 00:02:44.350
swallowing the liquid form might be a

00:02:44.480 00:02:46.420
little bit better although if you have

00:02:47.000 00:02:49.120
problems with your hands then maybe the

00:02:49.850 00:02:51.550
pill form might be better so depends on

00:02:51.740 00:02:53.230
you I think they both probably have the

00:02:53.270 00:02:55.390
same type of efficacy in the United

00:02:55.640 00:02:57.280
States marijuana is still a Schedule one

00:02:57.320 00:03:01.380
drug but a DEA so that means that any

00:03:02.390 00:03:03.580
investigations are research done into

00:03:03.740 00:03:05.380
its medicinal purposes it's actually

00:03:05.690 00:03:06.880
illegal so the federal government can

00:03:07.040 00:03:08.530
give any money for that kind of research

00:03:09.050 00:03:10.240
so there has been a lot of actual

00:03:10.940 00:03:11.710
scientific research but there's been a

00:03:11.840 00:03:14.410
lot of anecdotal research and evidence

00:03:14.630 00:03:16.870
and people's stories so anecdotal

00:03:17.000 00:03:19.750
evidence shows that CBD helps with

00:03:20.200 00:03:23.530
dyskinesia it helps with tremors it

00:03:23.840 00:03:25.750
helps with pain certainly there's been a

00:03:25.910 00:03:27.190
lot of research done that it does help

00:03:27.230 00:03:31.300
with pain I have used CBD to help my

00:03:31.550 00:03:32.890
back pain I have very bad posture

00:03:33.410 00:03:36.310
because of Parkinson's and so I use CBD

00:03:36.860 00:03:39.190
to help alleviate that pain and it's

00:03:39.500 00:03:41.350
very useful for that if you liked this
