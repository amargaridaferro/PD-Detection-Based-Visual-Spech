Psycho is a novel from the early 90s

00:01:01.070 00:01:03.280
that sparked outrage gotten dropped by

00:01:03.440 00:01:04.780
its original publisher and then got

00:01:04.970 00:01:05.830
picked up by another one it's a

00:01:06.170 00:01:08.050
first-person character study of a 27

00:01:08.210 00:01:09.400
year old Wall Street investment banker

00:01:09.860 00:01:11.950
who happens to be a serial killer the

00:01:12.140 00:01:13.480
book is composed of his and erotic

00:01:13.759 00:01:15.400
thoughts displayed in excruciating

00:01:15.560 00:01:17.499
detail his name is Patrick Bateman and

00:01:17.869 00:01:20.050
in a 2016 Town &amp; Country article the

00:01:20.240 00:01:21.880
author Bret Easton Ellis describes him

00:01:22.130 00:01:26.200
as such perhaps he's a ghost an idea a

00:01:26.960 00:01:28.029
summing up of the values of that

00:01:28.580 00:01:29.710
particular decade filtered through my

00:01:30.080 00:01:32.050
80s literary sensibility moneyed

00:01:32.899 00:01:34.570
beautifully attired impossibly groomed

00:01:34.729 00:01:36.940
and handsome morally bankrupt totally

00:01:37.520 00:01:38.710
isolated and filled with rage a

00:01:39.530 00:01:41.109
gorgeously dressed and empty thing a

00:01:41.630 00:01:43.240
young man and directionless mannequin

00:01:43.640 00:01:45.969
hoping that someone anyone will save him

00:01:46.099 00:01:49.419
from himself nice summary there Bret

00:01:49.459 00:01:51.100
Easton Ellis is an American author based

00:01:51.319 00:01:52.960
in Los Angeles who broke out around the

00:01:53.149 00:01:55.630
age of 20 or 21 with less than zero

00:01:55.940 00:01:57.040
which I've reviewed on this channel

00:01:57.530 00:01:58.660
heavily inspired by Hemingway and

00:01:59.030 00:02:01.120
Stephen King his writing style is this

00:02:01.670 00:02:04.949
strange forever modern iconic cold

00:02:06.429 00:02:09.400
neutral detached horror minimalism

00:02:10.220 00:02:11.820
similar to William Gibson but far more

00:02:12.830 00:02:15.520
cynical very critical cruel basically

00:02:15.860 00:02:16.900
though of course that's mostly from the

00:02:17.300 00:02:18.400
content and the characters every

00:02:18.890 00:02:20.710
character just seems high as on

00:02:21.349 00:02:22.510
prescription pills and they sometimes

00:02:22.730 00:02:24.520
are no matter how outrageous or violent

00:02:24.620 00:02:26.110
or shocking the events and his stories

00:02:26.480 00:02:27.640
it's like their pulse never raises

00:02:27.830 00:02:29.020
they're never fazed no matter what

00:02:29.360 00:02:30.760
happens and this is especially true in

00:02:31.130 00:02:32.589
American Psycho the film adaptation is a

00:02:32.840 00:02:34.479
black comedy cult classic with an

00:02:35.180 00:02:36.220
indisputably perfect performance by

00:02:37.480 00:02:38.850
you like me have probably seen it

00:02:39.040 00:02:41.100
multiple times and may even occasionally

00:02:41.230 00:02:42.600
go back to YouTube to check out the

00:02:43.540 00:02:45.360
scene where he does a goofy little dance

00:02:45.549 00:02:47.220
to Kiwi Louis right before driving the

00:02:47.470 00:02:49.440
axe in the face of Jared Leto two more

00:02:49.780 00:02:50.880
iconic scenes from the film and the book

00:02:51.310 00:02:52.649
haunt the minds of everyone when I say

00:02:52.810 00:02:54.690
American Psycho the business card scene

00:02:54.909 00:02:56.100
were in Bateman has something like a

00:02:56.530 00:02:58.140
panic attack with a rambling internal

00:02:58.480 00:02:59.940
monologue outlining the superior

00:03:00.579 00:03:02.160
perfection of his competitions business

00:03:02.409 00:03:03.720
card and the scene where he describes

00:03:03.940 00:03:05.490
his morning routine in his post workout

00:03:06.129 00:03:07.770
strategy to remain youthful listing in

00:03:07.959 00:03:09.479
great detail all of the products and

00:03:10.359 00:03:12.479
moisturizers he uses in order to not age

00:03:13.209 00:03:14.699
in this way he's really similar to Yukio

00:03:14.920 00:03:16.050
Mishima characters especially in

00:03:16.510 00:03:18.030
confessions of a mask because Mishima

00:03:18.220 00:03:19.170
was obsessed with youth and beauty

00:03:19.900 00:03:20.879
believing that there was nothing more

00:03:21.579 00:03:23.039
devastatingly disgusting or wretched

00:03:23.379 00:03:25.110
than old age the omission is case is

00:03:25.299 00:03:26.610
probably stemmed from growing up with a

00:03:27.310 00:03:28.649
ridiculously eccentric grandmother in

00:03:28.900 00:03:30.180
spite of all the exaggeration in

00:03:30.670 00:03:32.550
American Psycho Ellis is portraying a

00:03:32.859 00:03:34.349
very real place in a young man's life

00:03:35.349 00:03:36.420
partially his own life after the early

00:03:36.760 00:03:38.069
success of less than zero and moving to

00:03:38.200 00:03:39.960
New York wondering what to do and who to

00:03:40.120 00:03:42.240
be the extreme dialogue that takes place

00:03:42.459 00:03:44.610
when we're feeling bitter or biting or

00:03:45.190 00:03:46.770
cynical critical emotionally drained

00:03:47.230 00:03:49.470
hollowed out by excess by desire by

00:03:50.410 00:03:51.990
expectation in jaded with vampiric

00:03:52.750 00:03:55.379
acquaintances or lovers or substances

00:03:55.900 00:03:56.939
when discussing the enduring popularity

00:03:57.430 00:03:58.770
of Patrick Bateman with Rolling Stone

00:03:59.079 00:04:01.020
years after the book's publication Ellis

00:04:01.329 00:04:04.110
said I created this guy who becomes this

00:04:04.449 00:04:05.939
emblem for yuppie despair in the Reagan

00:04:06.250 00:04:08.369
80s a very specific time in place and

00:04:09.370 00:04:11.250
yet he's really infused with my own pain

00:04:11.560 00:04:13.319
and what I was going through as a guy in

00:04:13.449 00:04:15.599
his 20s trying to fit into a society

00:04:15.849 00:04:17.640
that he doesn't necessarily want to fit

00:04:17.829 00:04:19.620
into but doesn't really know what the

00:04:19.750 00:04:21.899
other options are that was Patrick

00:04:22.210 00:04:24.060
Bateman to me it was trying to become a

00:04:24.340 00:04:26.219
kind of ideal man because that seemed to

00:04:26.260 00:04:28.110
be the only kind of guy that was

00:04:29.500 00:04:31.860
Bateman keeps saying I want to fit in I

00:04:32.680 00:04:36.120
felt that way too I want to fit in in

00:04:36.550 00:04:37.920
earlier interviews it seemed that Ellis

00:04:38.440 00:04:39.689
dismissed the idea that Batemans

00:04:40.030 00:04:41.760
thoughts were something akin to his own

00:04:42.610 00:04:43.890
at the time and that Bateman was

00:04:44.380 00:04:45.690
inspired by his father and the Wall

00:04:46.000 00:04:46.780
Street men Ellis was

00:04:47.030 00:04:48.520
hanging out with but he later a minute

00:04:48.620 00:04:50.260
that wasn't true sure you could say

00:04:50.660 00:04:52.240
Ellis is Bateman but it's more like one

00:04:52.790 00:04:54.720
very negative component of a personality

00:04:55.730 00:04:57.790
magnified and pushed into the extreme a

00:04:58.610 00:04:59.710
component that we all share by the way

00:05:00.530 00:05:02.410
which is why the book resonates Bateman

00:05:02.540 00:05:04.960
is sort of this nihilistic vacuum taking

00:05:05.090 00:05:06.880
in all the designer labels with his eyes

00:05:07.820 00:05:09.190
calculating every single one on every

00:05:09.680 00:05:11.770
single person male or female listing

00:05:11.930 00:05:14.050
them in excruciating detail sucking in

00:05:14.390 00:05:15.010
coke money

00:05:15.200 00:05:17.740
Jane bees on the rocks sorbet music Huey

00:05:17.960 00:05:20.710
Lewis and then lives the lives of people

00:05:21.530 00:05:23.530
small animals women and children on the

00:05:23.960 00:05:26.530
outside on the surface keyword in the

00:05:26.750 00:05:28.420
writing of Ellis he embodies what so

00:05:28.700 00:05:30.790
many young men want to be then and now

00:05:31.160 00:05:34.260
but on the inside he's this wretched

00:05:35.270 00:05:37.360
voracious monster that feasts in a

00:05:37.790 00:05:39.460
desperate excess without any semblance

00:05:39.740 00:05:42.070
of pleasure it's this numbed inability

00:05:42.110 00:05:44.200
to feel anything significant running

00:05:44.390 00:05:45.880
theme through the work of Ellis this

00:05:46.460 00:05:48.580
total glacial eyes personality that

00:05:48.920 00:05:50.590
lives to seek but can never find

00:05:51.140 00:05:53.080
anything can never hold on to something

00:05:53.450 00:05:55.120
and what separates American Psycho from

00:05:55.340 00:05:57.250
being an exercise in the combination of

00:05:57.770 00:05:59.590
violence and body parts and spectacular

00:06:00.260 00:06:01.600
displays of gore and nihilism and most

00:06:02.060 00:06:03.310
creative men are achievable something

00:06:03.440 00:06:04.600
like an updated hundred and twenty days

00:06:04.790 00:06:06.280
of Sodom with the addition of luxury

00:06:06.710 00:06:08.140
brands though pieces of the book very

00:06:08.240 00:06:10.000
much resemble that are the passages

00:06:10.190 00:06:11.680
where Bateman is something close to

00:06:12.050 00:06:13.570
human many of these are short for

00:06:14.150 00:06:15.550
example the list of designer shoes and

00:06:15.710 00:06:17.980
ties and jackets seems to far outweigh

00:06:18.320 00:06:19.900
in sheer words the moments of a

00:06:20.450 00:06:21.520
disturbing and poignant reflection on

00:06:21.620 00:06:23.140
the part of Bateman but because of this

00:06:23.480 00:06:25.390
because of the you know the interruption

00:06:25.580 00:06:28.390
in the vacuous lists they're chilling

00:06:28.940 00:06:30.640
there wasn't a clear identifiable

00:06:31.100 00:06:32.950
emotion within me except for greed and

00:06:33.590 00:06:35.860
possibly total disgust I had all the

00:06:36.260 00:06:37.630
characteristics of a human being

00:06:38.240 00:06:41.410
flesh blood skin hair but my

00:06:42.410 00:06:44.380
depersonalization was so intense had

00:06:44.600 00:06:46.810
gone so deep that the normal ability to

00:06:47.030 00:06:49.060
feel compassion had been eradicated the

00:06:49.460 00:06:51.550
victim of a slow purposeful erasure I

00:06:52.490 00:06:54.640
was simply imitating reality a rough

00:06:55.250 00:06:56.950
resemblance of a human being with only a

00:06:57.230 00:06:58.270
dim corner of my mind

00:06:58.930 00:07:00.550
functioning something horrible was

00:07:00.590 00:07:02.500
happening and yet I couldn't figure out

00:07:02.630 00:07:06.010
why I couldn't put my finger on it the

00:07:06.170 00:07:07.360
only thing that calms me was the

00:07:07.970 00:07:09.190
satisfying sound of ice being dropped

00:07:09.380 00:07:10.470
into a glass of J&amp;B

00:07:11.480 00:07:12.730
it's like the cynicism of the character

00:07:12.889 00:07:14.530
from Dostoevsky notes from underground

00:07:14.900 00:07:16.780
and the deep longing to fit in that you

00:07:16.940 00:07:18.580
could find in something like again

00:07:19.100 00:07:20.470
confessions of a mask by Yukio Mishima

00:07:20.660 00:07:22.180
and the sexual violence of the Marquis

00:07:22.250 00:07:24.190
de Sade and twenty days of Sodom you

00:07:24.320 00:07:25.629
know because there's a lot of lists and

00:07:26.150 00:07:26.710
same with this one

00:07:26.930 00:07:28.060
but with the main character modeled

00:07:28.190 00:07:29.650
after Gordon Gekko from the movie Wall

00:07:29.960 00:07:32.140
Street it's a really black satire so

00:07:32.360 00:07:34.870
it's comedic in part the word zany would

00:07:35.030 00:07:36.430
not be inappropriate to describe the

00:07:36.650 00:07:38.350
scene where he's popping Halcyon going

00:07:38.450 00:07:39.640
on a shopping spree in bloomingdales

00:07:40.040 00:07:41.380
I'll be honest it took me a long time to

00:07:41.570 00:07:42.700
finish and many points to the

00:07:43.100 00:07:44.110
description of designer garments had me

00:07:44.510 00:07:46.030
praying for violence in the next page as

00:07:46.340 00:07:48.130
a purely meditational catharsis for

00:07:48.590 00:07:50.110
being forced to read the names Zegna and

00:07:50.600 00:07:52.210
Alan Edmund yet again and then you

00:07:52.700 00:07:53.770
instantly understand how Ellis could

00:07:53.930 00:07:55.480
write something like this after hanging

00:07:55.729 00:07:56.920
around men having conversations about

00:07:57.290 00:07:58.540
 like that it's part of the whole

00:07:59.030 00:08:00.370
literary mechanism the painful

00:08:00.979 00:08:02.140
repetitious obsession solidifies

00:08:02.660 00:08:04.480
Batemans reality but we never find out

00:08:04.669 00:08:06.670
if it is indeed real if he did murder

00:08:06.979 00:08:08.469
another Wall Street guy or his ex

00:08:09.020 00:08:10.360
girlfriend or a ton of women again

00:08:10.910 00:08:12.040
frequently disembodied in graphic

00:08:12.560 00:08:14.140
creative detail it's a critique of male

00:08:14.750 00:08:16.330
narcissism at the time though in a

00:08:16.669 00:08:18.520
hideous twist of irony it's inspired a

00:08:18.830 00:08:20.380
whole new chapter of millennial

00:08:21.020 00:08:22.540
self-indulgence there's definitely a

00:08:22.910 00:08:24.940
cult of Patrick Bateman he has become a

00:08:25.460 00:08:27.190
cultural icon for masculine narcissism

00:08:27.890 00:08:29.200
some fitness figures on YouTube even

00:08:29.720 00:08:31.090
modeled themselves after him there is

00:08:31.400 00:08:33.550
undoubtedly a group of men dedicated to

00:08:34.280 00:08:35.860
emulating Batemans attention to detail

00:08:36.289 00:08:38.440
his prissy over-concerned status

00:08:38.659 00:08:40.300
conscious compulsions in fact it's

00:08:40.430 00:08:42.219
become the norm in many circles you can

00:08:42.349 00:08:43.180
check out an article in the description

00:08:43.610 00:08:45.340
box below why modern men can identify

00:08:46.040 00:08:48.940
with Patrick Bateman you're like wow

00:08:49.730 00:08:51.400
maybe it was an unintentionally accurate

00:08:51.920 00:08:54.520
prophecy of young postmodern post Empire

00:08:54.710 00:08:57.280
in Ellis terms men who are so lonely an

00:08:57.530 00:08:59.079
empty inside that they've created a

00:08:59.330 00:09:00.910
religion out of self worshipping excess

00:09:01.820 00:09:03.850
consumerism luxury goods occasionally

00:09:04.130 00:09:05.680
looking for something greater looking up

00:09:06.260 00:09:09.310
but only finding this dead hollow space

00:09:10.040 00:09:11.230
filling Batemans hollow space in the

00:09:11.750 00:09:16.480
is stuff entertainment products there

00:09:16.520 00:09:18.070
are these bizarre music reviews that

00:09:18.230 00:09:20.500
just go on and on again here we Luis in

00:09:20.570 00:09:22.060
the news is the famous one Patrick

00:09:22.550 00:09:23.830
constantly rents these videotapes and

00:09:24.650 00:09:26.680
the the term I have to go return some

00:09:26.810 00:09:29.440
videotapes is now a meme right it's a

00:09:29.690 00:09:31.330
euphemism for murder Bateman and Myers

00:09:31.760 00:09:33.130
Donald Trump and the art of the deal

00:09:33.530 00:09:34.390
different Trump in a different era

00:09:34.640 00:09:36.310
though and Ellis says in an article that

00:09:37.250 00:09:38.530
Bateman would not be a trump supporter

00:09:38.990 00:09:40.390
he would be embarrassed by him Bateman

00:09:40.790 00:09:42.310
hates the working class found this

00:09:42.590 00:09:43.840
interesting David Foster Wallace

00:09:44.330 00:09:45.640
attacked the novel in an interview

00:09:46.040 00:09:47.770
saying if readers simply believe the

00:09:47.990 00:09:49.750
world is stupid and shallow and mean

00:09:50.060 00:09:51.910
then Ellis can write a mean shallow

00:09:52.490 00:09:53.980
stupid novel that becomes a mordant

00:09:54.530 00:09:56.230
deadpan commentary on the badness of

00:09:56.660 00:09:59.080
everything look man we'd probably most

00:09:59.240 00:10:00.850
of us agree that these are dark times

00:10:01.280 00:10:03.400
and stupid ones but do we need fiction

00:10:03.560 00:10:05.500
that does nothing but dramatize how dark

00:10:05.660 00:10:07.840
and stupid everything is oddly enough

00:10:08.210 00:10:09.670
the repetitious mental listing of

00:10:10.340 00:10:11.380
high-status designer label fashion

00:10:12.050 00:10:13.720
accessories luxury products alcoholic

00:10:14.150 00:10:15.090
beverages and restaurant food

00:10:16.100 00:10:17.410
descriptions feels just like reading

00:10:17.960 00:10:20.500
Wallace's Infinite Jest footnotes and

00:10:20.780 00:10:21.760
nothing against Wallace it's a fair

00:10:21.950 00:10:23.740
criticism but I think American Psycho is

00:10:23.780 00:10:25.660
a unique confession but not

00:10:26.510 00:10:28.120
confrontation of emptiness a portrayal

00:10:28.460 00:10:30.640
of inner post rock-bottom but even worse

00:10:30.920 00:10:33.010
an acceptance of it and in some moments

00:10:33.140 00:10:35.260
a disturbing celebration like Lucifer

00:10:35.540 00:10:37.750
and Paradise Lost in his new kingdom of

00:10:38.960 00:10:41.530
hail hail infernal world and thou

00:10:42.260 00:10:43.930
profoundest hell right Bateman is an

00:10:44.300 00:10:45.630
archetype and that's why above all

00:10:46.640 00:10:48.160
before any label you put on it I would

00:10:48.560 00:10:50.380
view this book as a warning be careful

00:10:50.870 00:10:53.200
what you admire and be careful where you

00:10:53.450 00:10:55.090
place your devotion very much like

00:10:55.430 00:10:57.040
Paradise Lost in that sense and I think

00:10:57.290 00:10:58.120
Ellis would agree with that description

00:10:58.880 00:11:00.310
strip the comedy and style away and you

00:11:00.350 00:11:02.590
have a painful moment of lucidity that

00:11:02.720 00:11:05.020
is worth meditating on God or the idea

00:11:05.089 00:11:07.060
of is rarely mentioned in American

00:11:07.250 00:11:08.500
Psycho I don't think this is a

00:11:08.750 00:11:10.329
coincidence and it seems like a smart

00:11:11.000 00:11:12.820
deliberate move on Ellis is part when we

00:11:13.100 00:11:14.620
start the book the Bateman is already

00:11:15.080 00:11:17.140
far beyond redemption in fact that's one

00:11:17.180 00:11:19.510
of his defining characteristics but we

00:11:19.850 00:11:22.000
see the existential consequences it's as

00:11:22.130 00:11:23.590
if a man is being torn apart on the

00:11:23.960 00:11:24.850
inside by God

00:11:25.160 00:11:27.580
yet does his best to defy him in order

00:11:27.710 00:11:29.350
to convince himself of his own power of

00:11:29.480 00:11:31.540
his own existence anything a feel-good

00:11:31.910 00:11:34.630
novel absolutely not except occasionally

00:11:34.760 00:11:36.340
when it's hysterically funny but for

00:11:36.590 00:11:37.990
certain moments in your life when

00:11:38.510 00:11:40.570
exploring your shadow it might be better

00:11:40.730 00:11:42.280
than failure now who's gonna get it
