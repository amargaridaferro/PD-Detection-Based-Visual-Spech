00:00:05.850 00:00:07.249
hi this is Manny Chamberland the

00:00:07.859 00:00:08.720
occupational therapist with seniors

00:00:09.090 00:00:10.820
flourish I'm just gonna show you a quick

00:00:10.860 00:00:12.140
little technique that you can use with

00:00:12.210 00:00:14.180
your patients that have Parkinson's

00:00:14.519 00:00:17.170
that perform retro pulgin during

00:00:18.180 00:00:20.779
functional transfers so what that means

00:00:20.939 00:00:23.150
is basically instead of the patient

00:00:23.970 00:00:26.000
shifting forward with their weight in

00:00:26.279 00:00:28.040
order to perform a safe functional

00:00:28.529 00:00:30.410
transfer they are pushing backwards they

00:00:30.599 00:00:33.139
call them pushers so one some of the

00:00:33.420 00:00:35.720
equipment that I use for this is um I

00:00:36.059 00:00:38.569
have red tubing right there a tubing but

00:00:38.700 00:00:40.160
you can use any kind of string or rope

00:00:40.410 00:00:41.600
or anything you have in the clinic and

00:00:41.700 00:00:43.459
then something to weigh down each of the

00:00:43.829 00:00:45.440
ends and I have some fancy hand

00:00:45.960 00:00:48.229
sanitizer and a chip so basically

00:00:48.629 00:00:50.330
anything you can come up with you can

00:00:50.520 00:00:53.959
use for this activity okay some of you

00:00:54.090 00:00:56.510
have maybe seen the technique where you

00:00:56.850 00:00:59.029
have a pillow or a ball like a therapy

00:00:59.160 00:01:02.260
ball or balloon and then you have the

00:01:06.409 00:01:08.420
patient set up in the position you want

00:01:08.580 00:01:10.460
and have them lean forward so they touch

00:01:10.680 00:01:12.770
the pillow to the floor so they shift

00:01:12.990 00:01:14.660
their weight forward in order to stand

00:01:14.909 00:01:17.240
up properly well I don't know about you

00:01:17.280 00:01:20.210
but most of my older adults that I work

00:01:20.250 00:01:22.219
with they need something to hold on to

00:01:22.590 00:01:25.249
it's just not safe to do that transfer

00:01:26.189 00:01:28.999
and most the time when I'm teaching them

00:01:29.340 00:01:31.749
these techniques or they're gonna be

00:01:32.759 00:01:34.340
getting off a bad they're gonna be

00:01:34.650 00:01:36.830
getting off commode so I'm you know

00:01:37.290 00:01:39.319
naturally I'm wanting them to hold on to

00:01:40.170 00:01:43.580
a stabilizing armrest or something so

00:01:44.130 00:01:45.499
that's probably not the most functional

00:01:46.020 00:01:47.420
so that's why I kind of thought of this

00:01:47.640 00:01:49.639
um technique so let me get this out of

00:01:49.710 00:01:53.210
the way and what I excuse is my band

00:01:53.460 00:01:55.370
like I've seen and I have them put it

00:01:55.500 00:01:57.530
around their neck of course that we're

00:01:57.600 00:01:59.359
all going to have we do that with me

00:01:59.790 00:02:02.240
while we're doing training so have them

00:02:02.610 00:02:06.109
get in their position and I'm gonna be

00:02:06.479 00:02:09.419
using this as a visual cue or even made

00:02:09.700 00:02:10.740
a little bit of a technical cubics that

00:02:10.810 00:02:12.270
you probably feel it through the

00:02:13.900 00:02:15.839
onto the floor but basically I'm gonna

00:02:16.030 00:02:17.520
have them scooch it into the chair like

00:02:17.560 00:02:19.589
a would normally anyway get their legs

00:02:19.810 00:02:23.459
in good position and let this hang so

00:02:23.799 00:02:26.610
that when they are leaning forward they

00:02:26.650 00:02:30.629
can still hold on and they can look down

00:02:31.180 00:02:33.800
and/or feel through the pull on the band

00:02:34.810 00:02:36.599
that they that the weight is touching

00:02:36.700 00:02:38.129
the floor so that means they shifted

00:02:38.200 00:02:40.110
their weight enough that they can stand

00:02:40.439 00:02:43.979
up so that is just one of my techniques

00:02:44.230 00:02:46.409
that I've been using for some of my

00:02:46.840 00:02:47.940
patients I have Parkinsons and it's been

00:02:48.280 00:02:50.280
working really well I think it's a

00:02:51.239 00:02:54.409
really practical technique instead of

00:02:55.419 00:02:56.729
something that they can actually feel

00:02:57.340 00:02:58.679
because they can't necessarily feel it

00:02:58.780 00:03:01.170
in their own body while they're doing

00:03:01.450 00:03:03.030
that functional transfer so if you have

00:03:03.370 00:03:04.830
something then they can see and they can

00:03:05.079 00:03:08.179
feel while they're doing the transfer

00:03:09.189 00:03:12.209
that helps for safer transitional

00:03:12.370 00:03:15.030
movement and weight shift forward so

00:03:15.220 00:03:17.309
that they're not standing backwards but

00:03:17.500 00:03:18.449
they're transferring their weight

00:03:19.269 00:03:21.509
forward so hope you like this video and

00:03:22.030 00:03:23.369
if you liked it or if you thought it was

00:03:23.530 00:03:24.629
really helpful you want to share with

00:03:24.879 00:03:26.879
other therapists that would be great I'd

00:03:27.459 00:03:29.099
really appreciate it and if there's any

00:03:29.229 00:03:30.719
other techniques or any other tips that

00:03:30.849 00:03:32.879
you think you would like to learn more

00:03:33.099 00:03:35.610
about I'm gonna be doing some randomly

00:03:36.090 00:03:38.610
and so I'm always open to suggestions

00:03:39.009 00:03:40.289
and you can always find me on seniors

00:03:40.689 00:03:43.859
