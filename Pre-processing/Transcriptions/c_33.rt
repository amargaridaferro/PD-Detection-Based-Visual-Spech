00:00:13.840 00:00:18.070
it's scarborough from

00:00:18.480 00:00:22.150
and today we want to talk about

00:00:22.560 00:00:26.470
something that is near and dear to us

00:00:26.960 00:00:30.310
it's uh me

00:00:30.720 00:00:33.430
being a senior blogger or

00:00:34.000 00:00:36.790
a uh would you say

00:00:37.440 00:00:41.270
an older blogger uh

00:00:41.680 00:00:45.910
that's what i am so

00:00:46.160 00:00:49.190
what is this all about

00:00:50.480 00:00:54.150
well i went to google

00:00:55.039 00:00:58.069
and i did a search

00:00:58.640 00:01:03.110
on uh senior bloggers

00:01:03.359 00:01:05.750
so i could see what these people were

00:01:06.640 00:01:11.030
and uh maybe get some ideas on what i

00:01:11.360 00:01:14.310
should be vlogging about since i

00:01:14.640 00:01:17.749
don't have that many uh subscribers

00:01:17.920 00:01:21.350
in my youtube channel

00:01:23.600 00:01:24.870
so it was for my

00:01:25.520 00:01:28.789
interest and my help

00:01:29.680 00:01:32.789
well you type in senior blogger

00:01:35.040 00:01:37.830
vlogger and you get

00:01:38.159 00:01:43.510
get something like uh seniors

00:01:44.240 00:01:46.630
graduating from high school and all this

00:01:46.960 00:01:51.109
other stuff and everything

00:01:52.000 00:01:54.149
but what i want

00:01:54.399 00:01:59.030
to find google's algorithms

00:01:59.439 00:02:02.709
and uh finding

00:02:03.600 00:02:06.389
these senior or

00:02:06.960 00:02:10.790
older bloggers must be off

00:02:10.959 00:02:15.910
and what i'm saying is

00:02:16.319 00:02:19.990
there are very few

00:02:20.840 00:02:24.949
if any any

00:02:25.840 00:02:28.630
senior vloggers well it's not gonna stop

00:02:33.680 00:02:36.790
uh well let's get back to it

00:02:38.480 00:02:41.190
well it's

00:02:41.519 00:02:46.309
i'm probably the only

00:02:47.200 00:02:51.830
59 year old blogger

00:02:52.080 00:02:55.750
i think i can't find them

00:02:56.480 00:03:00.309
they're kids and

00:03:00.640 00:03:04.790
young adults and there are some

00:03:05.120 00:03:10.309
that are in their 30s but

00:03:10.640 00:03:15.110
but no body i've seen so far

00:03:15.680 00:03:19.030
is a senior

00:03:23.120 00:03:25.990
youtube is not a new technology

00:03:26.319 00:03:32.070
it's a old technology and uh

00:03:32.319 00:03:35.190
you might think that maybe

00:03:35.360 00:03:39.509
the older generation doesn't uh

00:03:39.840 00:03:43.110
get it they don't know how to

00:03:43.360 00:03:46.630
do it well i'm sure if i

00:03:46.959 00:03:50.309
i know how to do it uh that there are

00:03:50.799 00:03:55.350
plenty more people out there

00:03:55.519 00:04:00.390
that can do it so

00:04:00.640 00:04:05.750
what is the beep

00:04:06.000 00:04:09.350
i said why we

00:04:10.000 00:04:13.030
my generation

00:04:17.040 00:04:21.030
the internet

00:04:21.440 00:04:25.590
they created youtube

00:04:26.840 00:04:31.110
and so it only makes sense

00:04:31.680 00:04:35.030
that uh

00:04:35.360 00:04:38.790
that there should be

00:04:39.919 00:04:44.390
senior bloggers or older vloggers

00:04:44.720 00:04:49.909
but it has morphed into

00:04:50.080 00:04:53.430
a younger generation

00:04:53.840 00:04:58.150
taking this medium over

00:04:58.800 00:05:01.430
so i'm not saying this bad

00:05:03.199 00:05:05.909
but it's

00:05:08.840 00:05:09.990
it's uh

00:05:10.160 00:05:12.950
it makes one don't get me wrong i'm not

00:05:13.919 00:05:17.990
on anybody i'm pondering

00:05:18.800 00:05:25.670
so when i look on youtube

00:05:26.000 00:05:30.870
for bloggers i expect to see

00:05:31.199 00:05:34.390
some older gentlemen i might be

00:05:34.560 00:05:39.270
the only older gentleman on youtube

00:05:39.520 00:05:42.390
as far as i can find

00:05:42.800 00:05:46.550
i'm sure there's more but where

00:05:46.720 00:05:49.670
i don't know

00:05:50.720 00:05:54.070
well here's one of the things you get

00:05:54.880 00:05:58.950
with a senior vlogger

00:06:00.240 00:06:03.350
well you get experience

00:06:05.840 00:06:07.350
experience is something

00:06:07.680 00:06:10.790
that people need

00:06:11.120 00:06:14.550
like i started a uh

00:06:14.720 00:06:17.830
a playlist on my uh

00:06:18.840 00:06:24.150
youtube channel carl burke

00:06:26.000 00:06:27.189
ama ask me

00:06:29.199 00:06:31.990
anything anything

00:06:32.800 00:06:35.430
so people can ask me and get my

00:06:35.759 00:06:38.710
two cents it doesn't mean that i'll

00:06:38.960 00:06:42.230
be right but

00:06:42.560 00:06:45.909
ask me so

00:06:46.160 00:06:48.550
would it be someone that you would want

00:06:48.720 00:06:49.430
to ask this

00:06:50.000 00:06:54.150
question that is two years old

00:06:54.880 00:06:57.189
i don't know or

00:06:57.680 00:07:01.589
18 years old

00:07:02.240 00:07:05.029
it's it's mind-boggling

00:07:05.599 00:07:09.270
and these these younger bloggers

00:07:14.840 00:07:16.390
on youtube

00:07:17.120 00:07:21.270
people are asking all these questions

00:07:27.199 00:07:28.230
really and

00:07:28.560 00:07:31.270
they take that

00:07:32.560 00:07:35.270
uh answer that's given by these

00:07:36.479 00:07:38.870
vloggers these younger vloggers

00:07:39.039 00:07:42.309
to the bank don't get me wrong

00:07:42.560 00:07:45.350
i'm not hating on anybody

00:07:46.160 00:07:48.790
so i know i'm ranting on about this

00:07:50.319 00:07:52.469
because it is a uh

00:07:54.720 00:07:57.270
concern of uh

00:07:57.440 00:08:02.550
of mine and uh

00:08:02.879 00:08:07.510
i just don't understand it

00:08:07.919 00:08:13.430
so uh i don't know

00:08:14.160 00:08:17.749
