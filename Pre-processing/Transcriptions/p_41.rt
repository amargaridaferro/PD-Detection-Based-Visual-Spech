00:00:01.800 00:00:04.490
hi everybody Jasmine here okay

00:00:04.950 00:00:06.320
I'm finally making this video with the

00:00:06.480 00:00:07.490
big announcement I've been trying to

00:00:07.560 00:00:09.320
make this video over the past like week

00:00:09.599 00:00:10.610
and things have just all got in the way

00:00:10.650 00:00:13.160
but I'm finally here to tell you the big

00:00:13.590 00:00:14.600
secret project I've been working on that

00:00:15.059 00:00:17.390
I'm so thrilled to announce but before I

00:00:17.550 00:00:19.130
do that for anyone who hasn't been

00:00:19.529 00:00:20.840
following along for a little while I'm

00:00:21.210 00:00:23.540
sort of with my life and work my name is

00:00:23.730 00:00:26.000
Jasmine stirrer I am I did actually just

00:00:26.310 00:00:27.880
had a birthday adjust from 25 years old

00:00:28.890 00:00:30.200
and I have now had Perkins in this

00:00:30.449 00:00:33.410
disease for almost 11 years I have

00:00:34.140 00:00:36.470
juvenile onset Parkinson's disease and I

00:00:37.140 00:00:39.020
started having serious symptoms when I

00:00:39.210 00:00:44.510
was about 14 and I got my diagnosis in

00:00:44.879 00:00:47.029
college I had brain surgery in college I

00:00:47.160 00:00:50.930
went to college to study chemistry and I

00:00:51.090 00:00:52.130
had always had my heart set on being

00:00:52.920 00:00:54.529
either a doctor or working in research

00:00:54.829 00:00:56.720
field both interested me in different

00:00:57.170 00:01:00.139
ways and I had such an intensive

00:01:00.420 00:01:01.610
experience with the patient community

00:01:02.039 00:01:03.229
that I really thought medicine was the

00:01:03.420 00:01:03.799
way to go

00:01:04.290 00:01:05.390
I've actually helped lied to med school

00:01:05.909 00:01:08.960
twice I applied to med school two months

00:01:09.119 00:01:10.820
after having brain surgery which is a

00:01:11.580 00:01:12.140
terrible idea

00:01:12.299 00:01:14.539
by the way I was a senior at college and

00:01:14.939 00:01:17.630
a couple months into college it became

00:01:17.909 00:01:19.039
really clear I needed to take a break

00:01:19.290 00:01:21.800
for my health and so I took a break for

00:01:21.930 00:01:23.570
my health and I had another job lined up

00:01:24.710 00:01:29.240
and that year towards the end of my by

00:01:29.310 00:01:30.590
the time I was finished at my chemistry

00:01:30.780 00:01:33.770
degree in 2016 my health just crashed

00:01:34.290 00:01:36.200
and it hit a really low point so when I

00:01:36.720 00:01:38.149
graduated I was definitely the sickest

00:01:38.490 00:01:42.109
I've been um and I started ID nutrition

00:01:42.600 00:01:47.840
right after for a related to Parkinson's

00:01:48.270 00:01:49.819
it's a secondary to Parkinson's is she

00:01:49.890 00:01:51.289
who called gastroparesis and chronic

00:01:51.509 00:01:53.179
intestinal pseudo obstruction where does

00:01:53.280 00:01:54.499
the whole another thing I don't really

00:01:54.630 00:01:56.780
need to explain right now but I went

00:01:56.939 00:01:58.880
home to get healthy and in going home to

00:01:58.979 00:02:01.789
get healthy I ended up accidentally

00:02:02.310 00:02:04.550
starting a career in research act is an

00:02:05.009 00:02:06.679
advocacy and in citizen science and end

00:02:06.750 00:02:07.969
of one research which I'll explain a

00:02:08.039 00:02:09.050
little bit more about what that all

00:02:09.810 00:02:11.980
as I continue to sort of explain this

00:02:12.990 00:02:14.570
development and how I got to this

00:02:15.030 00:02:16.340
announcement that I'm sorry I haven't

00:02:16.590 00:02:18.110
said yet but there was just a lot of

00:02:18.540 00:02:23.870
backstory here so I accidentally became

00:02:24.030 00:02:28.070
an activist I gave a talk it was put on

00:02:28.230 00:02:29.510
by my dear friend Sarah gar from

00:02:29.850 00:02:32.000
sleeping hi Sarah um thank you for

00:02:32.900 00:02:35.060
everything this all all of my career

00:02:35.190 00:02:36.170
would not have been possible with Sarah

00:02:36.840 00:02:40.970
without Sarah and like I will never be

00:02:41.370 00:02:43.640
thankful enough for that and the work we

00:02:43.740 00:02:46.520
do together continuing continuing that

00:02:46.680 00:02:47.900
has continued from that initial

00:02:48.660 00:02:50.690
collaboration is directly what has

00:02:51.030 00:02:57.199
brought us here today so ok that was

00:02:57.630 00:03:00.530
that project I was a chemistry major

00:03:01.020 00:03:03.080
without a lab I watched all of my

00:03:03.300 00:03:04.520
friends go to graduate school in medical

00:03:04.800 00:03:06.020
school and everyone else was out there

00:03:06.209 00:03:07.699
living their lives and I was home trying

00:03:07.980 00:03:10.280
to stay alive and so I started doing

00:03:10.680 00:03:12.130
some of my own research on my own health

00:03:13.140 00:03:14.630
my body became my laboratory in my

00:03:14.850 00:03:16.630
kitchen became my investigative bench

00:03:17.640 00:03:22.100
and I I just I started doing a bunch of

00:03:22.170 00:03:23.990
research and reading and I found

00:03:24.780 00:03:26.210
solutions that my doctors weren't coming

00:03:26.280 00:03:29.270
up with for myself and Sarah I was

00:03:29.489 00:03:31.220
organizing a talk at World Parkinson's

00:03:31.380 00:03:33.050
in 2016 which was held in Portland

00:03:33.380 00:03:35.180
Oregon which I was actually planning on

00:03:35.400 00:03:36.670
attending my dad and I were driving up

00:03:37.680 00:03:40.610
and Sarah I had shared this talk and

00:03:41.370 00:03:42.979
this this stuff I was working on about

00:03:43.620 00:03:44.620
ten days before

00:03:45.630 00:03:47.240
before giving before world Parkinson's

00:03:47.489 00:03:50.449
and Sarah had messaged 22 year old me

00:03:51.000 00:03:52.970
saying hey actually not even 22 year old

00:03:53.400 00:03:56.360
22 year old yet got munch I say hey you

00:03:56.519 00:03:58.580
know doesn't I really liked your work I

00:03:59.190 00:04:01.520
want you to talk at the quantified self

00:04:01.980 00:04:04.130
for Parkinson's talk that I am

00:04:05.030 00:04:06.890
organizing the day before World

00:04:07.470 00:04:08.630
Parkinson's begins that's sort of it

00:04:09.150 00:04:13.240
well Parkinson's adjacent talk and so I

00:04:14.250 00:04:16.250
said yes and it was the best thing I've

00:04:16.290 00:04:19.010
ever said yes to you ever because I was

00:04:19.140 00:04:21.890
able to meet other people who had

00:04:22.680 00:04:24.560
science backgrounds and who had

00:04:24.930 00:04:28.040
Parkinson's who had also essentially

00:04:28.470 00:04:29.600
treated their health and their lives

00:04:30.060 00:04:32.420
like their case study and their lat like

00:04:32.669 00:04:36.409
their their experiment and it opened up

00:04:36.630 00:04:37.730
this whole new world for me that I had

00:04:37.889 00:04:40.790
thought I'd lost and so over the next

00:04:41.010 00:04:42.379
couple years I stayed with it we

00:04:42.570 00:04:45.290
actually based on my talk we designed a

00:04:45.570 00:04:47.360
n of one experiment which is and one

00:04:47.550 00:04:50.300
means a in science and n is like your

00:04:51.060 00:04:51.710
population group that you're studying

00:04:51.990 00:04:53.810
and so an N of 1 meaning population of 1

00:04:54.210 00:04:54.920
you're yourself so that's what

00:04:55.080 00:04:56.690
an affluent science means citizen

00:04:57.060 00:05:00.590
science is when patients patients come

00:05:00.840 00:05:02.330
together to influence research or to do

00:05:02.580 00:05:04.820
research themselves and so that's what

00:05:04.919 00:05:06.860
we did we did carried out a citizen

00:05:07.110 00:05:08.390
science project we designed a project to

00:05:08.490 00:05:10.280
be done at World Parkinson's and we were

00:05:10.470 00:05:12.680
able to actually get a panel of

00:05:12.870 00:05:14.240
reviewers and we published an article in

00:05:14.280 00:05:16.940
a scientific journal a journal and I had

00:05:17.850 00:05:19.460
all I can close to couple times like in

00:05:19.970 00:05:22.190
my undergraduate career Publishing's I

00:05:22.380 00:05:24.110
had you know I'd had posters and

00:05:24.389 00:05:26.450
everything but I hadn't had a first

00:05:27.030 00:05:29.600
authored paper and having a first

00:05:30.060 00:05:31.580
authored paper was like the most

00:05:31.890 00:05:32.930
exciting thing that ever happened to me

00:05:33.810 00:05:37.460
at that point working on this and

00:05:37.740 00:05:38.840
becoming health advocate I started

00:05:38.970 00:05:40.760
working with Stanford medicine X and in

00:05:41.160 00:05:42.980
2018 I actually got to go to Stanford to

00:05:43.110 00:05:44.480
be their new patient coordinator for the

00:05:45.080 00:05:46.840
conference for one of the conference's

00:05:47.850 00:05:50.570
and I got to go teach at Stanford to

00:05:50.910 00:05:54.230
talk to two students who were going into

00:05:54.300 00:05:55.879
the medical field and I've gone through

00:05:56.070 00:05:57.379
the all these incredible things and I

00:05:57.600 00:05:59.210
really thought all that was count was

00:05:59.729 00:06:02.029
was telling me to go be a doctor I had

00:06:02.190 00:06:03.740
this driving passion and I was so

00:06:04.110 00:06:07.719
excited I was you know I thought that I

00:06:08.729 00:06:10.010
would take everything that I've learned

00:06:11.780 00:06:14.690
because when I had growing up growing up

00:06:15.000 00:06:16.279
sick growing up with this mystery

00:06:16.889 00:06:18.909
diagnosis that took years to diagnose

00:06:19.970 00:06:22.550
every misdiagnosis I had impacted the

00:06:22.680 00:06:23.840
way I feel about the healthcare field

00:06:24.030 00:06:25.850
the way I see it the way I experienced

00:06:26.450 00:06:29.570
it every one of those experiences felt

00:06:29.669 00:06:31.790
like it was telling me to go and take

00:06:33.410 00:06:36.050
patience that you know my calling was to

00:06:36.240 00:06:39.950
go live my life in that way so be a

00:06:40.500 00:06:42.530
physician who did things differently and

00:06:43.580 00:06:46.610
so this year I decided to go for it

00:06:46.650 00:06:52.450
again and in 20 June June 1st 2019 I

00:06:53.460 00:06:54.890
submitted an application once again to

00:06:55.170 00:06:56.900
medical school and then the summer

00:06:57.120 00:07:01.400
happened and I had an amazing summer I

00:07:01.950 00:07:03.320
travel an amazing an awful summer I

00:07:03.780 00:07:05.210
traveled to Stanford twice this summer

00:07:05.790 00:07:07.370
to teach at the Stanford and c2 summer

00:07:07.800 00:07:08.870
institute for high school and college

00:07:09.480 00:07:10.520
students who are entering the medical

00:07:10.680 00:07:13.120
field and an amazing time doing that and

00:07:14.130 00:07:16.880
I also had had a stomach surgery between

00:07:17.700 00:07:21.110
those two that actually sort of kind of

00:07:21.540 00:07:23.030
vague and my career again in a different

00:07:23.100 00:07:26.120
way I wasn't expecting um they ended up

00:07:26.540 00:07:29.660
leaving they end up using a tube that I

00:07:29.820 00:07:31.670
was allergic to was at a g-tube surgery

00:07:32.520 00:07:34.490
it was allergic to and and you can't

00:07:34.620 00:07:35.810
really mess with the stoma that's that

00:07:36.000 00:07:39.590
new because the stoma can move here and

00:07:39.720 00:07:42.020
you could end up with um did your

00:07:42.330 00:07:43.130
stomach I don't sneak me into I would

00:07:43.380 00:07:44.990
didn't and giving serious it's a very

00:07:45.419 00:07:48.830
very serious people have died from stoma

00:07:48.990 00:07:51.409
is not adhering and causing peritoneal

00:07:51.750 00:07:55.280
sepsis and um even though my to was

00:07:55.710 00:07:57.409
giving me severe allergic symptoms to a

00:07:57.690 00:08:01.159
point where um I was like really

00:08:01.500 00:08:02.620
struggling to breathe we ended up

00:08:03.630 00:08:06.070
suppressing my name system for the month

00:08:07.080 00:08:11.300
with some really intense steroids and it

00:08:12.380 00:08:16.520
was it was a really manic month which

00:08:16.980 00:08:17.930
you know let's think this probably

00:08:18.240 00:08:19.760
sounds like it would be kind of normal

00:08:19.800 00:08:21.080
for me and it is a little bit normal for

00:08:21.180 00:08:22.760
me I think Parkinson's with your slave

00:08:22.890 00:08:24.470
the way it affects your sleep cycle

00:08:24.750 00:08:27.470
makes you a little bit manic but I had

00:08:27.870 00:08:30.590
so much energy from the prednisone and

00:08:31.260 00:08:35.089
no energy from my body and so one day at

00:08:35.339 00:08:38.240
3 a.m. I was sitting awake and but I

00:08:38.430 00:08:40.579
always in doing it 3:00 a.m. whenever my

00:08:40.770 00:08:42.110
body is keeping me awake because I just

00:08:42.330 00:08:43.540
read um

00:08:43.969 00:08:45.550
rabbit hole of science and I learn about

00:08:45.740 00:08:48.240
some really interesting things

00:08:49.250 00:08:52.680
everything from diseases to science to

00:08:53.690 00:08:56.079
rockets to space to you know random

00:08:56.510 00:08:57.820
historical bits I I just I like to learn

00:08:58.430 00:09:00.340
middle of the night when I just my

00:09:00.980 00:09:02.440
body's not letting me so I figured my

00:09:02.630 00:09:05.019
brain is might as well be happy and I

00:09:05.120 00:09:06.250
was sitting there and sometimes I just

00:09:06.470 00:09:08.949
sit there I think and I was thinking

00:09:09.170 00:09:10.480
about my work because I had done in the

00:09:10.640 00:09:12.639
past and that I had like been doing um

00:09:13.339 00:09:14.680
and I was thinking about Perkins in the

00:09:14.959 00:09:17.139
research and what I thought was missing

00:09:17.450 00:09:19.180
in Perkins research and it hit me so

00:09:20.060 00:09:21.340
over the past couple years we have done

00:09:21.560 00:09:22.960
some different experiments and I've

00:09:23.300 00:09:24.759
designed quite a few experiments but

00:09:24.980 00:09:27.220
none of them have completely come to

00:09:27.380 00:09:28.900
fruition in the way I wanted them to the

00:09:29.000 00:09:32.019
way that I want to publish the mass and

00:09:32.660 00:09:34.420
that's because something was missing to

00:09:34.610 00:09:39.579
all of them and the thing that was

00:09:39.970 00:09:43.060
missing so all of them is the idea I

00:09:43.279 00:09:45.759
have here in this backpack it that's the

00:09:46.130 00:09:49.930
big announcement that I have for you now

00:09:50.450 00:09:52.060
so let's start with this

00:09:52.370 00:09:55.720
I'm not going to med school and I'm

00:09:56.029 00:09:56.889
telling you that with the smile on my

00:09:56.930 00:10:04.389
face because I am so relieved and the

00:10:04.640 00:10:08.260
only reason see I was I think you know

00:10:09.200 00:10:11.079
when people who I've told this idea to

00:10:11.870 00:10:14.829
that I'm gonna do instead nobody's

00:10:15.230 00:10:18.819
surprised um and at first that kind of

00:10:19.100 00:10:20.199
bothered me a little bit like hey look

00:10:20.329 00:10:21.190
you know what I appreciated the faith

00:10:21.470 00:10:23.199
guys glad you all didn't think I was

00:10:23.360 00:10:25.240
gonna go to med school but I'm gonna

00:10:25.430 00:10:26.500
take that as a compliment look they all

00:10:26.630 00:10:27.850
thought I was gonna do something that

00:10:28.420 00:10:30.490
would be more impactful that would be

00:10:31.130 00:10:32.889
more in a more impactful way to use my

00:10:33.320 00:10:37.389
life in my time here because I'm at a

00:10:38.000 00:10:40.900
really rough stage in Parkinson's right

00:10:41.500 00:10:44.800
now where I've had it so long and

00:10:45.740 00:10:48.519
managing symptoms a lot and I'm at a

00:10:48.769 00:10:52.530
point where I feel my body slowing down

00:10:53.540 00:10:54.310
I'm at a point where the average

00:10:54.860 00:10:56.720
lifespan of somebody with Parkinson's

00:10:56.820 00:10:59.660
Derr symptom onset is 16 years and I'm

00:10:59.850 00:11:03.939
at 13 and right 11 so I have you know I

00:11:04.949 00:11:06.350
I don't want my only live for five more

00:11:06.420 00:11:10.699
years I would like to pass 30 I'd like

00:11:10.829 00:11:12.560
to pass for you know maybe even 50s who

00:11:12.779 00:11:15.470
knows maybe I'll even grow old but I

00:11:16.139 00:11:18.199
have to in order to grow old right in

00:11:18.420 00:11:21.290
order to grow older than a tragically

00:11:21.540 00:11:25.400
short time I need to take care of my

00:11:25.670 00:11:28.160
body and pushing it through Medical

00:11:28.199 00:11:32.569
School is not taking care of my body and

00:11:32.820 00:11:34.310
it's not respecting my body and its

00:11:34.889 00:11:36.650
limitations and appreciating it for what

00:11:36.750 00:11:40.460
it can do and I I know I think I had to

00:11:40.620 00:11:43.639
come to this conclusion because I had to

00:11:44.040 00:11:47.090
realize that me leaving medical school

00:11:47.370 00:11:48.829
behind was not me saying that I wasn't

00:11:49.170 00:11:49.910
somewhere enough to do it or that I

00:11:50.190 00:11:51.230
couldn't have done it if I really tried

00:11:52.050 00:11:54.470
but me choosing to be happy and me

00:11:54.810 00:11:57.530
choosing to live and me choosing to want

00:11:57.810 00:12:01.220
to live and to continue should be happy

00:12:01.350 00:12:02.990
until not to live I'm actually have a

00:12:03.360 00:12:06.199
really good place in life I'm really

00:12:06.449 00:12:10.009
happy like I'm really really enjoying my

00:12:10.649 00:12:12.290
mid-20s I'm rocking it I

00:12:12.720 00:12:16.550
I have happiness and life and love and

00:12:16.680 00:12:19.939
I'm excited about the future um for kind

00:12:20.069 00:12:22.129
of the first time in a little while for

00:12:22.260 00:12:23.990
the past couple years the future has

00:12:24.240 00:12:26.569
kind of been a thing I like to dream

00:12:26.760 00:12:29.840
about but a dream was never really going

00:12:30.000 00:12:35.030
to be a reality and so now I think I

00:12:35.399 00:12:36.769
really do think that if I take care of

00:12:36.870 00:12:39.980
my body I can make it last a long time

00:12:40.319 00:12:43.100
and I can keep going and I want to do

00:12:43.290 00:12:46.699
that so I need to stop living that way

00:12:46.980 00:12:49.240
and stop pushing myself and instead

00:12:50.250 00:12:52.059
focus my energy and loop with intent

00:12:53.069 00:12:53.930
living with intent is something that's

00:12:54.000 00:12:55.970
very important to me

00:12:57.500 00:13:00.710
because when you have limited energy you

00:13:00.810 00:13:03.199
know sometimes I see other you know

00:13:03.480 00:13:07.550
young healthy people and I I try to like

00:13:08.160 00:13:09.889
comprehend what energy is like and it's

00:13:11.570 00:13:14.110
i I've been sick now for so long I can't

00:13:15.120 00:13:17.900
comprehend a normal level of energy um

00:13:18.390 00:13:20.870
and not planning every aspect of my day

00:13:23.420 00:13:27.020
around like how I feel and like what's

00:13:27.300 00:13:30.770
gonna physically work um heck I've had

00:13:30.990 00:13:33.620
days with Parkinson's I can't move also

00:13:34.110 00:13:35.570
a lot of my time honestly with

00:13:36.090 00:13:38.630
Parkinson's is laying in bed kind of

00:13:39.710 00:13:42.050
reclining and I'm also at a point where

00:13:42.090 00:13:44.780
I can say it's okay if I spend sixty

00:13:45.060 00:13:46.520
four sixty seventy percent of my time in

00:13:47.610 00:13:49.100
um it's not okay if I do that if I'm a

00:13:49.340 00:13:52.070
physician from training trying to go to

00:13:52.260 00:13:54.770
med school because I'm not gonna be the

00:13:55.140 00:13:57.680
student I wanted to be with my body the

00:13:57.810 00:14:00.020
way it is and that's only gonna be

00:14:00.480 00:14:04.280
frustrating and then the most

00:14:04.620 00:14:06.110
heartbreaking thing I could ever see

00:14:06.600 00:14:08.750
happening to me would be to get through

00:14:09.090 00:14:11.750
medical school and get into this job I

00:14:11.940 00:14:12.950
thought I was gonna be a primary care

00:14:12.990 00:14:14.600
physician and I was gonna work in an

00:14:14.910 00:14:16.490
underserved area in inner city and I was

00:14:16.740 00:14:20.030
going to pass on this like a radical

00:14:20.340 00:14:24.200
love for healthcare and for this this

00:14:24.930 00:14:27.280
idea that every human being deserves

00:14:28.290 00:14:31.220
compassionate care and that like that is

00:14:31.380 00:14:33.260
where my experience taken me and like I

00:14:33.450 00:14:34.990
thought about loving this job every day

00:14:36.000 00:14:39.910
and how amazing that would be and I

00:14:40.920 00:14:42.170
can't imagine loving it for a year and

00:14:42.390 00:14:45.550
then having it all taken away from me I

00:14:46.560 00:14:48.440
can't imagine wanting to love it so bad

00:14:48.690 00:14:51.730
but being so tired that I hate it I

00:14:52.740 00:14:54.860
can't imagine loving my job that being

00:14:55.350 00:14:57.140
so exhausted that nobody else in my life

00:14:57.750 00:15:01.010
gets any of my energy that nobody else

00:15:01.260 00:15:04.250
in my life gets any part of me that

00:15:04.730 00:15:06.710
isn't everything I'm pouring into this

00:15:07.470 00:15:09.530
to do it for a couple years only to

00:15:09.660 00:15:12.820
satisfy myself really even if I am doing

00:15:13.830 00:15:18.620
it for a good reason it's still not for

00:15:18.690 00:15:20.610
the right ones

00:15:21.620 00:15:24.400
and so I'm letting go and it feels

00:15:24.649 00:15:28.180
amazing because I have this incredible

00:15:28.339 00:15:30.790
idea that I came up with at 3:00 a.m. on

00:15:31.490 00:15:34.180
prednisone in the middle of July that is

00:15:34.700 00:15:36.430
a piece of the Parkinson's research

00:15:37.130 00:15:38.829
puzzle that I feel is vitally missing

00:15:39.050 00:15:43.030
and I am in the unique capacity to do it

00:15:43.399 00:15:47.620
and that is my project that I'm

00:15:48.970 00:15:51.730
announcing this project is going to be

00:15:52.310 00:15:54.490
my career this is going to be the mark

00:15:54.680 00:15:56.370
that I make on Parkinson's research and

00:15:57.380 00:16:00.190
this is going to be huge and I'm going

00:16:01.329 00:16:04.090
to follow it as long as it takes me as

00:16:04.430 00:16:05.440
far as it takes me really the

00:16:05.690 00:16:07.120
possibilities are endless because once

00:16:07.310 00:16:09.670
we build up our initial okay this makes

00:16:09.800 00:16:11.110
no sense unless I just explained to you

00:16:11.180 00:16:14.019
the project so without further ado also

00:16:14.300 00:16:15.819
this is a space backpack I got at Target

00:16:16.579 00:16:20.350
to hold my stuff for this project it's

00:16:20.600 00:16:21.699
really soft and it's got those little

00:16:22.070 00:16:23.860
mermaid sequins and I just thought it in

00:16:23.959 00:16:25.569
this little star keychain just drew to

00:16:25.670 00:16:26.920
me and I thought you know this is this

00:16:27.140 00:16:29.920
is like a dream bag this is exactly what

00:16:30.140 00:16:36.189
needs to house this project but I

00:16:36.620 00:16:39.759
introduced you the lab notebook of the

00:16:40.130 00:16:42.040
Parkinson's Phenom project which I've

00:16:42.260 00:16:43.509
named myself the principal investigator

00:16:46.089 00:16:48.759
because everybody in science wants to be

00:16:49.730 00:16:51.490
principal of I'm an investigator of a

00:16:52.190 00:16:53.380
research project like that is sort of

00:16:53.510 00:16:55.449
when you've made it in science and since

00:16:55.970 00:16:57.730
I'm essentially forging my own path with

00:16:57.890 00:16:59.470
this I realized that a traditional

00:16:59.779 00:17:02.340
career is never going to work for me a

00:17:03.350 00:17:04.419
traditional career you unless I went to

00:17:04.579 00:17:06.880
grad school for research I can't hold a

00:17:07.209 00:17:09.220
nine-to-five because half the time I'm

00:17:09.319 00:17:10.390
up at 2:00 in the morning on the other

00:17:10.610 00:17:12.220
half the time I sleep for 36 hours in a

00:17:12.380 00:17:14.380
row and then I'm not for four days it's

00:17:15.079 00:17:18.400
completely completely sporadic and what

00:17:18.439 00:17:22.030
I can do is I can work from my bed and I

00:17:22.970 00:17:25.030
have a because of my experience and

00:17:25.760 00:17:26.919
because of the things I've done in the

00:17:27.049 00:17:28.570
past couple of years and the experience

00:17:29.240 00:17:30.640
that I've lived combined with the

00:17:31.190 00:17:31.830
education that I've had

00:17:32.049 00:17:34.850
and the passions that I have um

00:17:35.860 00:17:37.379
connections I've made makes me the

00:17:37.779 00:17:40.019
person who can do this project so with a

00:17:40.450 00:17:45.590
phenome a genome in biology is

00:17:46.600 00:17:48.539
essentially a database of all of the by

00:17:49.090 00:17:51.060
all the gene pairs all the genes all in

00:17:51.159 00:17:53.730
the genetic basis all the all of the the

00:17:54.039 00:17:57.350
codes that make you you is your genome

00:17:58.360 00:18:00.480
so a genotype is something that you

00:18:00.970 00:18:02.940
express because you have a gene I have

00:18:03.159 00:18:04.649
blue eyes actually I have green eyes I

00:18:04.929 00:18:06.210
have green eyes because I have a gene

00:18:06.460 00:18:10.889
for green eyes um a phenotype

00:18:11.470 00:18:19.470
um and algae is sort of a group of um it

00:18:19.659 00:18:20.759
doesn't so much work as well with this

00:18:21.070 00:18:23.399
experiment without with the example a

00:18:24.220 00:18:25.519
phenotype is essentially a

00:18:26.529 00:18:28.259
characteristic that is described of a

00:18:29.519 00:18:32.399
group that isn't necessarily associated

00:18:32.559 00:18:34.680
with I mean a lot of times phenotypes

00:18:34.899 00:18:36.619
are the doing of associating with genes

00:18:37.629 00:18:38.519
but a phenotype can also just be

00:18:38.830 00:18:41.789
separate than that um and Parkinson's

00:18:42.129 00:18:43.889
now also I I wrote this is my horrible

00:18:44.110 00:18:46.529
handwriting um and I did this with me

00:18:47.830 00:18:49.830
because I wanted it to mine because in

00:18:50.049 00:18:52.590
science you get a very standard lab

00:18:53.289 00:18:54.960
notebook and as long as I keep the lab

00:18:55.149 00:18:56.609
notes to laboratory things no one cares

00:18:56.799 00:18:57.629
what the outside my notebook looks

00:18:58.059 00:19:01.799
except for me so they go I have a little

00:19:01.929 00:19:03.629
date for when I establish the nonprofit

00:19:03.820 00:19:05.639
oh the nonprofit I should tell you about

00:19:05.980 00:19:07.769
that I'm sorry I'm getting really ahead

00:19:07.869 00:19:10.350
of myself okay so I have this research

00:19:10.600 00:19:12.749
idea I want to do and I want to

00:19:12.879 00:19:15.180
establish a non-profit so that I have

00:19:15.309 00:19:16.769
the funding to do it and the funding to

00:19:16.990 00:19:19.200
pay contributors and okay one thing and

00:19:19.299 00:19:20.460
that is getting ahead of myself

00:19:20.679 00:19:22.649
okay it took me 19 minutes and 20

00:19:23.019 00:19:23.970
seconds to just tell you what the

00:19:24.309 00:19:26.249
friggin project is I'm gonna phenotype

00:19:27.820 00:19:30.659
okay so Park that's on to really crazy

00:19:30.820 00:19:35.789
I'm sorry Parkinson's is a huge umbrella

00:19:36.730 00:19:39.289
of diseases that all have to do with

00:19:40.299 00:19:42.220
damage to the substantia

00:19:42.500 00:19:47.230
love your brain and Parkinson's has so

00:19:47.330 00:19:49.810
many different symptoms at one point I

00:19:49.850 00:19:51.100
just tried to list as many as I could

00:19:51.200 00:19:54.340
and counted and I got 30 close to 30 um

00:19:55.190 00:19:56.380
different symptoms and the thing about

00:19:57.260 00:19:58.480
Parkinson's is that everybody who has

00:19:58.910 00:20:00.310
Parkinson's the cool markings in the

00:20:00.770 00:20:01.780
snowflake disease cuz no one who has

00:20:02.090 00:20:03.070
Parkinson's really looks like another

00:20:03.260 00:20:05.500
person has Parkinson's um

00:20:06.380 00:20:09.160
which makes you know for a huge array of

00:20:09.830 00:20:10.570
presentations which is why it can be

00:20:10.850 00:20:13.030
hard to diagnose because a lot of people

00:20:13.280 00:20:15.880
think of Parkinson's as a shakey stumped

00:20:16.160 00:20:20.260
over old man I am a stumped over the

00:20:20.450 00:20:24.250
right mild tremor quite muscley tight 25

00:20:24.440 00:20:26.350
year old woman who is has pretty much

00:20:26.720 00:20:28.930
advanced age Parkinson's disease so I

00:20:29.510 00:20:31.660
fit basically none of the stereotypes

00:20:31.970 00:20:33.580
which is why I love going into rooms now

00:20:34.010 00:20:35.200
we have you know of health in the

00:20:35.450 00:20:37.000
healthcare sphere and sing out

00:20:37.640 00:20:38.800
Parkinson's because I love challenging

00:20:38.930 00:20:41.890
that narrative because that keeps you

00:20:42.080 00:20:43.900
over being diagnosed that's a whole

00:20:44.150 00:20:45.550
nother change in I'm sorry back to the

00:20:45.890 00:20:47.770
phenome so there's all these different

00:20:48.050 00:20:51.580
things that can happen in Parkinson's so

00:20:51.770 00:20:53.320
many different symptoms and different

00:20:54.400 00:20:56.290
presentations but we in the community

00:20:56.420 00:20:58.330
are seeing patterns that scientific

00:20:58.370 00:21:01.180
research is not now why is that

00:21:01.790 00:21:03.850
important so we in the community see

00:21:04.130 00:21:05.740
that different symptoms tend to clump

00:21:05.960 00:21:07.510
together in different populations and we

00:21:07.670 00:21:09.160
can pretty much identify them but

00:21:09.530 00:21:10.690
science isn't studying them studying

00:21:10.820 00:21:12.520
this science is studying Parkinson's the

00:21:12.890 00:21:15.010
umbrella as a whole all however many

00:21:15.530 00:21:17.440
diseases are within this umbrella are

00:21:17.690 00:21:19.480
all being stated as one disease because

00:21:19.640 00:21:22.590
they have the same underlying pathology

00:21:23.600 00:21:24.340
but they might have different mechanisms

00:21:25.040 00:21:26.440
and those differences are important

00:21:26.570 00:21:27.970
because when you think about clinical

00:21:28.640 00:21:30.460
trials we have clinical trials that are

00:21:30.680 00:21:32.080
failing because they're only working for

00:21:32.270 00:21:34.120
some people and not the other and I'm

00:21:34.310 00:21:37.000
willing to bet that those if you if you

00:21:37.370 00:21:39.310
did an analysis of those clinical trials

00:21:39.590 00:21:41.260
that have failed that we're working for

00:21:41.390 00:21:42.730
some people and not the other you would

00:21:42.980 00:21:44.410
see phenotypic similarities between

00:21:44.870 00:21:47.890
those two but first before we can even

00:21:48.410 00:21:50.380
get into that kind of research nobody

00:21:50.720 00:21:54.670
has a database of Parkinson's which like

00:21:55.190 00:21:55.490
this one

00:21:55.890 00:21:57.320
explain this project I think this is the

00:21:57.480 00:21:59.900
one thing that really makes people say

00:22:00.980 00:22:03.290
what and this is the part that makes me

00:22:03.480 00:22:05.450
say it what this is insane this is this

00:22:05.670 00:22:07.610
is what the insane something work this

00:22:07.770 00:22:10.250
is horrible like this is honestly we

00:22:10.470 00:22:12.440
should all be outraged that Parkinson's

00:22:12.930 00:22:15.110
does not have in one place that is

00:22:15.630 00:22:16.670
accessible to both patients and

00:22:17.430 00:22:20.540
researchers alike a list a compilation

00:22:21.060 00:22:23.660
of every symptom that can happen in

00:22:24.360 00:22:26.840
Parkinson's and that is my first thing

00:22:27.030 00:22:28.220
that is what I want to do that is the

00:22:28.650 00:22:30.190
phenome I want to characterize

00:22:31.200 00:22:32.930
Parkinson's I want to make a list of

00:22:33.390 00:22:34.730
everything that is Parkinson's and I

00:22:34.950 00:22:37.130
want to do that combining accepted

00:22:37.500 00:22:40.010
scientific information clinical data but

00:22:40.200 00:22:41.510
also with qualitative data from the

00:22:41.910 00:22:43.820
community that is completely ignored in

00:22:44.190 00:22:46.700
Clint in in the clinical world and in

00:22:46.800 00:22:48.260
the academic world of Parkinson's and

00:22:48.990 00:22:50.780
that is why this project can only be

00:22:50.940 00:22:53.110
done by somebody who it both has

00:22:54.120 00:22:55.430
collegiate science training and who can

00:22:55.890 00:22:59.650
speak and dialogue in the world of

00:23:00.660 00:23:01.670
Parkinson's science who can keep up with

00:23:02.280 00:23:04.310
researchers but also understands what

00:23:04.440 00:23:05.750
it's like to be patient and is also in

00:23:05.910 00:23:07.820
the patient community who has hundreds

00:23:07.980 00:23:09.740
of friends who I literally see with

00:23:09.900 00:23:11.330
these things who I've identified over

00:23:11.520 00:23:13.160
the years of being in the patient

00:23:15.380 00:23:17.810
community it's it's something that only

00:23:17.940 00:23:21.080
a couple of us can do and I'm gonna do

00:23:21.240 00:23:22.580
it and I'm gonna do it with the help

00:23:22.740 00:23:24.110
with the other couple people who can do

00:23:24.240 00:23:26.750
it um and everybody talk to them I'm

00:23:27.060 00:23:28.250
really excited I mean there's a couple

00:23:28.980 00:23:29.930
novel them there's a couple more I'm

00:23:30.150 00:23:33.080
still researching up who I'd love to

00:23:33.270 00:23:35.420
collaborate with so let's talk about how

00:23:35.460 00:23:37.490
I do this project so I am an

00:23:38.070 00:23:40.460
underemployed 25 year old like most

00:23:40.920 00:23:42.740
Millennials I kind of slide hustling I

00:23:42.810 00:23:44.180
do a bunch of random things to survive

00:23:44.940 00:23:47.060
um and health advocacy has brought me

00:23:47.250 00:23:48.650
some solid gigs but nothing that really

00:23:49.230 00:23:49.850
pays the bills

00:23:50.850 00:23:52.190
I'm also about to be kicked off my

00:23:52.530 00:23:54.620
parent's insurance next year so gotta

00:23:54.810 00:23:58.730
get a job so I can live but I want to do

00:23:58.920 00:24:00.980
research and I think this research is

00:24:01.470 00:24:03.980
important and so the only way that I'm

00:24:04.110 00:24:07.700
gonna be able to get to do my research

00:24:08.390 00:24:11.450
and you'll yeah I don't pay for my

00:24:12.000 00:24:13.730
infusions Oh pay for you know and end

00:24:13.950 00:24:15.110
paid bills and keep a roof over my head

00:24:15.690 00:24:17.120
the only way I'm gonna be able to do

00:24:17.310 00:24:19.400
that is to start something totally new

00:24:19.620 00:24:20.660
and to do it my own way and so I'm

00:24:20.820 00:24:23.210
starting on my own profit I am starting

00:24:23.370 00:24:25.340
on the Parkinson's phenome the 501 C

00:24:26.780 00:24:32.000
non-profit and I'm so excited I have it

00:24:32.100 00:24:34.820
all budgeted out I actually I thought

00:24:34.890 00:24:36.800
about grants and let me explain to you

00:24:37.080 00:24:39.950
why I'm not gonna go with a grand so

00:24:40.880 00:24:45.020
grand had strings in grass I will

00:24:45.410 00:24:48.340
absolutely be applying for down the line

00:24:49.350 00:24:50.480
for the project for different side

00:24:50.940 00:24:51.800
projects for different ventures for

00:24:52.200 00:24:54.140
example if I want to do a venture into a

00:24:54.510 00:24:55.970
certain subtype of you know -

00:24:56.550 00:24:58.250
classifying a certain subtype of

00:24:58.920 00:25:00.620
Parkinson's that I can identify once I

00:25:00.810 00:25:03.410
have this whole thing set up yeah

00:25:03.450 00:25:04.760
I would absolutely get a grant for

00:25:05.100 00:25:07.160
there's tons there I have like about 10

00:25:07.290 00:25:08.900
or 12 different ideas of things I would

00:25:08.940 00:25:10.340
have really liked to do sub projects

00:25:10.500 00:25:11.570
they'll be perfect for grants on the

00:25:11.790 00:25:15.980
lion but for the first base work for me

00:25:16.080 00:25:18.260
to be able to properly set the

00:25:18.870 00:25:20.870
foundation for a ton of science that can

00:25:21.090 00:25:22.220
be done in the future for a ton of

00:25:22.800 00:25:24.020
different things because it's not only

00:25:24.270 00:25:25.910
my work that I want to come from this I

00:25:26.490 00:25:28.640
want the phenome to create a bunch of

00:25:28.710 00:25:30.410
different science and I want the phenome

00:25:30.600 00:25:32.180
to become a basis for studying

00:25:32.910 00:25:33.890
Parkinson's because right now there is

00:25:34.200 00:25:36.440
not a basis of what Parkinson's even is

00:25:36.750 00:25:39.740
and that should bother us all so I'm

00:25:39.870 00:25:42.260
gonna create it but you know that's what

00:25:42.540 00:25:43.700
that's that's this is how I'm gonna do

00:25:43.830 00:25:46.910
it so I have set a fund rate we're gonna

00:25:47.100 00:25:48.500
do it crowdfunding style and we're gonna

00:25:49.050 00:25:51.160
we're gonna take this campaign out and

00:25:52.170 00:25:53.360
I'm gonna see how it does in the 21st

00:25:53.700 00:25:56.360
century so when you could be giving in

00:25:56.550 00:25:59.750
to a big name foundation when you're

00:26:00.120 00:26:02.750
hosting a Parkinson's fundraiser or you

00:26:02.880 00:26:05.030
know making a personal donation whether

00:26:05.220 00:26:07.190
it's everything from $1 to however many

00:26:08.070 00:26:10.790
it's all going to this project that's

00:26:10.980 00:26:13.820
gonna be a fair equitable and accessible

00:26:14.310 00:26:17.670
project um to the world a very open

00:26:18.210 00:26:21.420
and no secrets kind of project my idea

00:26:21.610 00:26:23.700
with this project is that my work is not

00:26:23.770 00:26:26.190
just my work my work for this project is

00:26:26.260 00:26:28.620
the world's work that's what I want this

00:26:28.810 00:26:30.990
to be I want everything that is done for

00:26:31.480 00:26:35.160
the phenome to be for Parkinson's and by

00:26:35.890 00:26:36.810
Parkinson's I mean people with

00:26:37.510 00:26:38.370
Parkinson's I mean Parkinson's

00:26:38.950 00:26:40.950
researchers I mean neurologists anyone

00:26:41.110 00:26:42.930
in the healthcare field patient you know

00:26:43.780 00:26:45.030
caregivers anyone has any connection to

00:26:45.670 00:26:46.710
Parkinson's I want this to be accessible

00:26:46.840 00:26:47.940
to on different levels

00:26:47.980 00:26:50.100
I want researchers to be able to consult

00:26:50.320 00:26:52.560
the phenome for an accurate picture of

00:26:53.170 00:26:53.820
Parkinson's when they're designing their

00:26:54.310 00:26:56.070
studies and I want patients to go to the

00:26:56.440 00:26:58.110
phenome so that they can look at all the

00:26:58.210 00:26:59.550
different things that can happen so if

00:26:59.890 00:27:00.810
something is going on that's really

00:27:01.150 00:27:02.940
confusing and they can't figure out what

00:27:03.040 00:27:04.620
it is maybe something in the phenome

00:27:05.230 00:27:06.360
will explain okay well this is a

00:27:07.030 00:27:07.800
possibility I can at least bring it up

00:27:07.900 00:27:09.420
to my doc and they can see if you know I

00:27:09.490 00:27:10.650
think this is also going on with me

00:27:11.020 00:27:12.480
because if you're just relying on your

00:27:12.850 00:27:15.900
doctor to be the only one the only one

00:27:16.510 00:27:18.390
who is providing and you kind of input

00:27:18.550 00:27:20.190
like that I mean that's how it should be

00:27:20.380 00:27:21.660
that's you there your doctor should be

00:27:21.850 00:27:23.520
able to but we all know from health care

00:27:24.430 00:27:27.560
how many times does it really happen

00:27:28.570 00:27:32.640
happen for me but so that's that's where

00:27:32.710 00:27:36.720
I'm at with this so the project is going

00:27:36.790 00:27:39.420
to be enough my goal is to crowdfund a

00:27:39.820 00:27:41.400
hundred thousand dollars and half of

00:27:41.560 00:27:43.500
that will go to being my salary so that

00:27:43.600 00:27:47.990
I can devote starting out a full year to

00:27:49.000 00:27:50.760
developing this to working forty hours a

00:27:50.860 00:27:52.950
week on building this Fino on a publicly

00:27:53.170 00:27:54.810
accessible platform to building a

00:27:55.270 00:27:56.550
website that has a bunch of security

00:27:56.890 00:28:02.010
built into it that can security built

00:28:02.170 00:28:04.020
into it that so that you know later on

00:28:04.240 00:28:05.310
because it's because this data related

00:28:05.410 00:28:07.100
to health that gets protected later on

00:28:08.110 00:28:09.000
building this website in a way that's

00:28:09.840 00:28:11.520
accessible collaborating with people is

00:28:11.590 00:28:14.340
a huge huge thing as what I want the

00:28:14.470 00:28:16.890
other half of that fund to have money

00:28:17.200 00:28:18.450
aside for us because I want to pay

00:28:18.730 00:28:20.250
people with Parkinson's to collaborate

00:28:20.410 00:28:22.980
with me I want to pay the community for

00:28:23.500 00:28:25.830
their value because so often in clinical

00:28:25.870 00:28:27.960
research were expected to just volunteer

00:28:28.630 00:28:30.130
because it's good for us in the long run

00:28:30.590 00:28:31.960
because we have Parkinson's and we

00:28:32.120 00:28:33.520
should want to see what comes out of it

00:28:33.740 00:28:34.660
and yeah

00:28:35.270 00:28:36.820
but I also want people who are there

00:28:37.010 00:28:38.320
because they're so interested in that

00:28:38.660 00:28:39.910
they're devoting a chunk of their time

00:28:40.570 00:28:43.690
and time is money you know that they

00:28:43.850 00:28:46.210
could be doing something else I want

00:28:46.850 00:28:49.930
them to feel that value that they're at

00:28:49.970 00:28:51.900
least that their their work is not just

00:28:52.910 00:28:55.060
for this project it's also because that

00:28:55.280 00:28:57.190
their work is important to the

00:28:57.770 00:28:59.200
scientific research community because it

00:28:59.360 00:29:01.390
is and our voices have not been valued

00:29:01.610 00:29:03.570
in the scientific research community and

00:29:04.580 00:29:05.650
epidemiologic studies have failed us so

00:29:05.900 00:29:07.900
long that if I want to take it back I

00:29:08.150 00:29:09.520
need to take it back in the most

00:29:10.400 00:29:13.650
equitable and forward way possible so

00:29:14.660 00:29:17.049
that is where that is why work we're

00:29:17.210 00:29:18.940
gonna once I get once I'm working on all

00:29:19.010 00:29:21.520
the paperwork right now I'm figuring out

00:29:21.590 00:29:24.580
my board of directors I'm getting

00:29:24.799 00:29:26.169
together all the things that I need and

00:29:26.630 00:29:27.820
I'm gonna put in the paperwork and so

00:29:28.280 00:29:29.860
hopefully in a couple of months I will

00:29:30.290 00:29:32.070
actually have this all ready to go

00:29:33.080 00:29:34.450
and in the meantime you know I'm gonna

00:29:34.640 00:29:35.440
figure out something different Club

00:29:37.299 00:29:40.330
works work on different ideas and get

00:29:40.520 00:29:42.640
all their if things kind of ready so

00:29:42.770 00:29:44.140
that once we're ready to go we can hit

00:29:44.299 00:29:45.310
the ground running and we can start

00:29:45.830 00:29:50.470
developing this and I am so so beyond

00:29:52.179 00:29:54.310
excited to get to update this as I go on

00:29:54.770 00:29:56.230
and to get to share this journey with

00:29:56.510 00:29:58.870
the community that has really given me

00:29:59.150 00:30:02.110
so much like I'm nothing emotionally

00:30:02.830 00:30:04.750

thank you thank you for showing me that

00:30:22.520 00:30:26.130
just because my scientific journey is

00:30:27.140 00:30:28.830
totally different than I ever imagined

00:30:29.840 00:30:31.900
and it's not anyway come like relatable

00:30:32.059 00:30:33.400

peers are doing you know what I think

00:30:36.169 00:30:37.590
all-time society says I should be doing

00:30:38.600 00:30:40.500
in my own my own head

00:30:40.960 00:30:44.460

done in a lot of situations and the way

00:31:41.799 00:31:43.019
epidemiological research has done around

00:31:43.470 00:31:45.330
diseases to a person with the disease

00:31:45.880 00:31:46.980
