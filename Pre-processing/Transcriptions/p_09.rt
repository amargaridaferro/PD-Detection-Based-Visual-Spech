00:00:04.009 00:00:06.680
I bought this children's shoe shop back

00:00:06.919 00:00:09.669
in 2017 looking at what I could do to

00:00:10.679 00:00:14.539
being in charge my own destiny it is a

00:00:14.759 00:00:15.709
bit of a struggle the moment cause

00:00:16.170 00:00:18.439
retail is not doing very well at all but

00:00:18.960 00:00:21.230
that aside this is the best thing I

00:00:21.570 00:00:22.609
could have done this gives me the

00:00:23.279 00:00:25.849
opportunity of working life balance with

00:00:25.890 00:00:28.009
my daughter beau to be able to pick her

00:00:28.050 00:00:30.589
up from school yeah it's fantastic we

00:00:30.779 00:00:32.540
have a lot of regular customers they're

00:00:32.759 00:00:34.430
used to me shaking they actually asked

00:00:34.710 00:00:36.979
me about my Parkinson's rather than just

00:00:37.440 00:00:38.810
looking instead you get the odd one it

00:00:38.910 00:00:40.880
just looks and stares the staff are

00:00:40.980 00:00:43.160
great they understand my Parkinson's so

00:00:43.770 00:00:44.990
they help me a lot

00:00:45.270 00:00:47.060
I've always managed people so I don't

00:00:47.399 00:00:49.790
find that a problem as such the only

00:00:50.010 00:00:52.100
thing that I find a problem now is the

00:00:52.739 00:00:55.760
fitting of shoes measuring of shoes with

00:00:56.280 00:00:57.529
children I tickle their feet with my

00:00:57.750 00:00:59.209
left hand but they don't mind too much

00:00:59.609 00:01:01.939
they just giggle when I'm on the till I

00:01:02.809 00:01:05.509
press two keys with one hand so I have

00:01:05.790 00:01:07.880
to do everything with my right hand

00:01:08.310 00:01:10.429
which is fine overall it's the best

00:01:10.590 00:01:13.600
decision I've ever made
