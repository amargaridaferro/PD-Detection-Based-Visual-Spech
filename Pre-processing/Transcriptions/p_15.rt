00:00:00.299 00:00:02.210
my name's Nick Pacific I'm 57 years old

00:00:02.550 00:00:03.830
I was diagnosed with Parkinson's on the

00:00:04.049 00:00:07.970
1st of September 2011 since then lots of

00:00:08.429 00:00:11.240
upheaval in my life but now I recently

00:00:11.639 00:00:13.970
moved for the 6th time in six years I've

00:00:14.519 00:00:16.279
recently moved into a house with my

00:00:16.640 00:00:18.680
girlfriend Susan and we now live in helm

00:00:18.960 00:00:21.290
in West Yorkshire and the Pennines not

00:00:21.420 00:00:23.000
too far from actually a lot of recession

00:00:23.340 00:00:25.580
rolled up in Lancashire and follow all

00:00:25.619 00:00:27.050
of us I think which is probably worse

00:00:27.090 00:00:29.620
than having Parkinson's from the health

00:00:30.630 00:00:32.240
what's it like well I get lots of

00:00:32.660 00:00:36.049

00:00:58.770 00:01:01.040
colleagues to be honest I'm sorting like

00:01:01.289 00:01:02.420
having back since well I've written a

00:01:02.609 00:01:03.439
poem that's the best way I can describe

00:01:03.809 00:01:06.830
it so here goes it's like tough

00:01:08.060 00:01:09.890
Parkinson's so what's it like living

00:01:10.530 00:01:13.370
with it with what really you know the

00:01:13.560 00:01:15.740
bit that's missing the bit that moves my

00:01:16.020 00:01:18.289
hand but not it seems for you so what's

00:01:18.450 00:01:21.410
it like well it's like my arms encased

00:01:21.630 00:01:23.600
in creamy fudge and though you try to

00:01:23.970 00:01:26.120
make it budget won't at first but then

00:01:26.460 00:01:29.060
once five or six some seconds delay I've

00:01:29.280 00:01:31.969
got to say it kind of does not straight

00:01:32.460 00:01:34.670
not pure but it moves your arm and as

00:01:34.860 00:01:37.429
it's you as it's yours you look you

00:01:37.770 00:01:40.539
smile you cry you wish lots more decides

00:01:41.549 00:01:44.420
that sighs tell me more tell me what

00:01:44.670 00:01:46.550
gives what do you feel what lives what

00:01:47.000 00:01:49.940
lives the same the same I'm still yet me

00:01:50.220 00:01:52.039
that cannot change but which will be at

00:01:52.350 00:01:53.960
times you see when dark The Tree of Life

00:01:54.420 00:01:57.230
it bends it forms a hug a canopy beneath

00:01:57.420 00:02:00.560
you sit you move you twitch it's like an

00:02:00.750 00:02:03.080
itch you'll never soothe your arms your

00:02:03.240 00:02:05.030
legs will never remove again so smooth

00:02:05.909 00:02:07.470
before it came this in a house

00:02:07.600 00:02:10.590
in pain but does it hurt what does it do

00:02:11.590 00:02:13.620
do you need help to get you through I do

00:02:14.020 00:02:14.610
I don't

00:02:14.920 00:02:16.530
I wish the latter I wish he were just

00:02:16.780 00:02:20.700
mind or matter you look you see but what

00:02:20.950 00:02:23.940
do you see the man I was before not now

00:02:24.280 00:02:26.640
not me I am I am I will admit just

00:02:26.920 00:02:29.430
slightly off not quite with it the pain

00:02:29.680 00:02:32.280
I guess is deep within the sudden soul

00:02:32.650 00:02:34.980
that needs her skin yet lie still joys

00:02:35.530 00:02:37.680
still there to live it is I am NOT is

00:02:37.900 00:02:41.010

00:02:45.250 00:02:48.060
