hi I'm Bruce Naylor and welcome to

00:00:01.949 00:00:04.309
coffee break and there we go equity

00:00:04.500 00:00:05.749
credit there long out-of-business

00:00:06.379 00:00:09.259
company anyhow this is the every week

00:00:09.540 00:00:11.180
that I want to post one of these and I

00:00:11.910 00:00:13.070
want to tell you what inspired to this

00:00:13.490 00:00:16.129
video and the whole idea of this video

00:00:16.320 00:00:17.570
is based on what I called me

00:00:18.180 00:00:18.980
incorporating you've probably heard me

00:00:19.199 00:00:20.750
talk about this before but my grandson

00:00:21.180 00:00:23.120
just got a job at a factory first time

00:00:23.369 00:00:25.519
in his life he's worked in a factory and

00:00:25.890 00:00:28.790
he's finding out that that he's not

00:00:29.039 00:00:30.679
allowed to have any breaks other than a

00:00:31.170 00:00:32.600
half-hour lunch break once a day and

00:00:32.700 00:00:34.430
that sound like a ten-hour shift with

00:00:35.040 00:00:37.280
mandatory overtime and the pay is not

00:00:37.829 00:00:41.090
that fantastic and that got us to

00:00:41.790 00:00:43.639
talking as a family well what can he do

00:00:43.950 00:00:45.860
to have a better situation and let's

00:00:46.079 00:00:47.930
talk about that for just met because I

00:00:48.450 00:00:50.810
know so many of you out there are kind

00:00:51.000 00:00:53.180
of frustrated with the way the economy

00:00:53.460 00:00:55.729
has worked out that the good-paying jobs

00:00:56.070 00:00:58.130
that so many politicians talk about have

00:00:58.850 00:01:00.889
disappeared so we can go back in the

00:01:01.109 00:01:02.209
past a little bit I can tell you all

00:01:02.340 00:01:05.690
about the 70s when I grew up it was a

00:01:05.939 00:01:07.280
much different time and you could get

00:01:07.619 00:01:09.590
jobs at factories like GM and Chrysler

00:01:09.840 00:01:12.620
and make a great living and buy a home

00:01:12.900 00:01:14.149
and get married have kids and get a

00:01:14.820 00:01:15.679
retirement and all that kind of stuff

00:01:15.960 00:01:18.080
but that's all went away and things have

00:01:18.710 00:01:20.590
changed thanks to globalization

00:01:21.600 00:01:24.380
outsourcing imports manufacturing kind

00:01:24.509 00:01:26.749
of went away the unions collapsed and

00:01:27.720 00:01:29.630
now we see a lot of problems for people

00:01:30.060 00:01:32.390
in the workplace now you know I have

00:01:32.670 00:01:35.090
always been a champion to those people

00:01:35.280 00:01:36.770
that start their own business because I

00:01:37.200 00:01:39.440
believe that's how you generate real

00:01:39.750 00:01:41.690
wealth you there's really two ways you

00:01:41.880 00:01:43.760
make money you either work for money or

00:01:44.460 00:01:46.580
money works for you and if you own a

00:01:46.890 00:01:48.530
business and that money is generally

00:01:48.840 00:01:51.469
working for you however not everybody

00:01:51.720 00:01:53.420
can do that and my wife and I jump in

00:01:54.149 00:01:55.760
conversation during dinner you know we

00:01:56.070 00:01:58.399
talked about some of what's going on in

00:01:58.500 00:01:59.959
the world and I wanted to share this

00:02:00.299 00:02:02.300
with you you've probably heard me as a

00:02:03.030 00:02:03.920
maybe I've said this earlier in the

00:02:04.049 00:02:06.800
video talked about me incorporated we

00:02:07.020 00:02:09.109
live very much in a gig economy

00:02:09.450 00:02:11.630
companies no longer expect to retain you

00:02:11.879 00:02:13.050
for a lifetime

00:02:13.270 00:02:14.850
and nor does the average employee expect

00:02:14.980 00:02:16.770
to work for a company for a lifetime

00:02:17.590 00:02:19.260
however long the gig last is that's what

00:02:19.450 00:02:20.160
you've got

00:02:20.770 00:02:23.340
the problem is with some of the mindsets

00:02:23.590 00:02:25.800
out there is that there's no reason to

00:02:25.990 00:02:28.620
learn additional skills and I totally

00:02:29.319 00:02:31.080
disagree we can all spend time working

00:02:31.420 00:02:33.780
on ourselves improving our situation our

00:02:34.630 00:02:36.360
knowledge and our marketable skills and

00:02:36.910 00:02:38.970
that's the point to always be marketable

00:02:39.489 00:02:41.910
and be ready for them next gig whether

00:02:42.160 00:02:44.250
its products or whether it's careers

00:02:45.070 00:02:46.710
there's a certain cycle to things

00:02:47.650 00:02:51.900
spring summer fall and winter and it's

00:02:52.150 00:02:53.580
always important to take a look at the

00:02:54.280 00:02:56.070
opportunities that are coming up for

00:02:56.260 00:02:58.410
what we call this spring the next new

00:02:58.450 00:03:01.050
thing and keep an eye on those and see

00:03:01.209 00:03:03.780
if your skill set can match up with that

00:03:04.060 00:03:08.430
what's going to be in demand the idea of

00:03:09.069 00:03:11.729
always be learning and that is so true

00:03:12.190 00:03:14.699
even today I spend a great amount of

00:03:14.950 00:03:17.819
time reading and learning new things and

00:03:18.730 00:03:20.460
practicing and honing new skills now

00:03:20.739 00:03:22.620
I'll admit I'm 58 years old and if I

00:03:22.930 00:03:24.509
found myself suddenly forced in the

00:03:25.120 00:03:26.759
workplace I do know that I have the

00:03:27.340 00:03:29.300
skillset to work in a sales position

00:03:30.310 00:03:31.650
because sales has always been good to me

00:03:31.780 00:03:34.319
as a craft is not just a skill basic

00:03:34.720 00:03:35.430
craftsmen I think I've done very well

00:03:35.769 00:03:37.170
with it and I'm sure I could land on my

00:03:37.450 00:03:39.240
feet but if that's not a career for

00:03:39.880 00:03:42.000
everybody but I also keep current on the

00:03:42.370 00:03:45.120
latest technologies and I keep going

00:03:45.280 00:03:47.099
back to school over and over again to

00:03:47.290 00:03:49.800
learn new things because learning is

00:03:50.530 00:03:51.780
fundamental to growing as a person and

00:03:52.359 00:03:53.550
maintaining those marketable skills I'm

00:03:53.709 00:03:56.370
not delusional however I know that in my

00:03:56.440 00:03:59.160
case age would work against me but there

00:03:59.410 00:04:01.560
comes a point where we must invest in

00:04:02.310 00:04:05.009
ourselves invest in yourself first and

00:04:05.410 00:04:06.840
when you learn new skills and when you

00:04:07.030 00:04:10.110
keep yourself marketable and you keep

00:04:10.780 00:04:12.449
looking and trying to plan that road

00:04:12.880 00:04:16.529
ahead that making that life roadmap then

00:04:17.109 00:04:19.620
you are ahead of the curve and we could

00:04:19.840 00:04:21.930
never stop because we just don't have

00:04:22.120 00:04:24.420
the type of type of economy says learn

00:04:24.700 00:04:25.780
this one thing

00:04:25.970 00:04:27.850
you're set for life those days were over

00:04:28.340 00:04:30.430
and the sooner you realize that you work

00:04:30.710 00:04:32.260
for yourself either directly or

00:04:32.810 00:04:35.110
indirectly the better off I think most

00:04:35.360 00:04:37.660
of us will be so on that now I'm going

00:04:37.730 00:04:40.030
to wrap up this edition of coffee break

00:04:40.220 00:04:41.410
and I hope to hear from you in the

00:04:42.290 00:04:42.820
comments down below

00:04:43.160 00:04:46.810
Bruce Taylor have a productive week
