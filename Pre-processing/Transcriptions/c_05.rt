00:00:01.260 00:00:03.050
hey everyone my name is Tammy Davis and

00:00:03.270 00:00:05.390
I really appreciate you watching and I

00:00:05.640 00:00:07.940
always look forward to questions because

00:00:08.099 00:00:11.030
it always gives me something to talk

00:00:11.150 00:00:13.640
about and in this case I've actually

00:00:13.920 00:00:15.350
already done one kind of along these

00:00:15.660 00:00:17.510
lines and I just finished writing a post

00:00:18.350 00:00:21.410
on lemon essential oil and so I'm not

00:00:21.689 00:00:23.120
necessarily going to go into that today

00:00:23.340 00:00:27.189
but that actually is what prompted me to

00:00:28.199 00:00:30.470
even do this particular video which is

00:00:30.840 00:00:35.120
around the area of essential oils and as

00:00:36.090 00:00:38.150
it affects brain health that's how I

00:00:38.399 00:00:41.150
want to say that so I was actually in a

00:00:41.879 00:00:44.950
conversation with someone earlier today

00:00:47.750 00:00:50.049
regarding toxicity and pollution and

00:00:51.059 00:00:53.900
health and it's interesting to me that

00:00:54.899 00:00:58.939
even though I realized that in our world

00:00:59.219 00:01:00.860
we really have done a good job of

00:01:01.590 00:01:03.369
classifying and kind of categorizing

00:01:04.379 00:01:05.329
various health conditions we're all

00:01:05.700 00:01:06.859
format for that matter all health

00:01:07.340 00:01:09.109
conditions when you take a broader

00:01:09.450 00:01:10.969
perspective I'm gonna I'm kind of cold

00:01:11.130 00:01:12.560
so I'm just a wrapped up its really

00:01:12.869 00:01:18.440
really to be here today when when we

00:01:18.600 00:01:21.109
take a broader perspective you can begin

00:01:21.330 00:01:23.030
to see how it's all related and with

00:01:23.460 00:01:25.249
what I also find equally fascinating is

00:01:25.500 00:01:27.280
just yesterday I was reading something

00:01:28.290 00:01:32.060
somebody had shared on Twitter but it

00:01:32.189 00:01:33.350
was an article that was written with

00:01:33.780 00:01:35.569
regards to the 30 year anniversary of

00:01:36.090 00:01:37.969
prozac or prozac's been on the year on

00:01:38.280 00:01:42.050
the market for 30 years and and they

00:01:42.329 00:01:45.200
even and in the illusion the the

00:01:45.689 00:01:46.999
assumption was is that we're really not

00:01:47.399 00:01:49.039
living with chemical imbalances and so

00:01:49.320 00:01:51.109
when I was reading the article it goes

00:01:51.329 00:01:53.030
into talking about how Hippocrates

00:01:53.610 00:01:55.910
believed that melancholia was a result

00:01:56.189 00:01:58.010
of imbalance with the fluid within the

00:01:58.409 00:02:00.740
system and the way the article was

00:02:01.200 00:02:04.270
written which was very very well done

00:02:05.780 00:02:09.499
the the the highlights the the points

00:02:09.629 00:02:12.420
that it illustrates in this

00:02:12.760 00:02:15.649
said it really demonstrated our

00:02:16.659 00:02:18.089
fluctuation and thought process how

00:02:18.579 00:02:20.640
we've gone from structural to chemical

00:02:20.890 00:02:23.420
and so we kind of go back and forth and

00:02:24.430 00:02:26.130
as to what is actually leading to

00:02:26.700 00:02:29.280
depression or melancholia or in this

00:02:29.530 00:02:31.500
case but as far as I'm concerned is

00:02:32.579 00:02:34.649
anxiety you know is it a chemical

00:02:34.780 00:02:37.589
imbalance or is it actually something

00:02:38.409 00:02:40.110
structural or you know there's all these

00:02:40.750 00:02:42.539
questions and like I said when you just

00:02:42.790 00:02:46.170
look at health in general you can begin

00:02:46.389 00:02:47.819
to see parallels and this particular

00:02:48.340 00:02:50.000
article that I just completed writing on

00:02:51.010 00:02:54.809
lemon essential oil I attempted to do

00:02:55.150 00:02:59.940
just that which is Express how why lemon

00:03:00.310 00:03:03.839
is not advisable for any long-term use

00:03:04.419 00:03:07.920
very much like lavender because it

00:03:08.560 00:03:10.409
influences the brain chemistry I mean we

00:03:10.569 00:03:12.809
can get into the specifics of it where

00:03:12.849 00:03:15.809
that it influences the activity of the

00:03:16.359 00:03:18.240
serotonin receptors and it increases the

00:03:18.489 00:03:20.580
rate of breakdown or metabolism of

00:03:21.040 00:03:23.069
dopamine and again like I said I wrote

00:03:23.229 00:03:24.719
about it this one I'm not gonna get into

00:03:24.909 00:03:26.849
it here but one of the byproducts are

00:03:27.489 00:03:29.039
one of them it's not even a byproduct

00:03:29.530 00:03:32.849
it's one use of dopamine when it is goes

00:03:32.889 00:03:35.550
through an auto oxidation process Auto

00:03:35.859 00:03:38.699
oxidation is a necessary process that

00:03:39.010 00:03:43.830
keeps the body proactive we'd like to

00:03:44.259 00:03:46.050
look at the body as dysfunctional and

00:03:46.780 00:03:48.960
diseased and truthfully when you're worn

00:03:49.090 00:03:51.420
out and tired it feel like crap and you

00:03:52.530 00:03:54.649
feel there's a lot of discomfort right

00:03:55.659 00:03:57.749
but the truth is is to get to that point

00:03:58.030 00:03:59.849
it was never diseas'd or dysfunctional

00:04:00.099 00:04:02.129
it was and it wasn't even out of balance

00:04:02.470 00:04:05.249
and this is what I talked about so I can

00:04:05.680 00:04:06.899
almost align with the fact that we're

00:04:07.030 00:04:08.849
not dealing with chemical imbalances is

00:04:09.099 00:04:11.309
it just a change in your thought process

00:04:11.799 00:04:16.379
I'd like to say that that is yes and at

00:04:16.509 00:04:18.509
the same time I don't necessarily know

00:04:18.820 00:04:20.099
that that's a hundred percent the case

00:04:20.440 00:04:22.379
it's a lot easier said than done having

00:04:22.570 00:04:24.180
been somebody that's lived along those

00:04:24.760 00:04:30.150
it's really difficult to to shift your

00:04:30.520 00:04:34.050
mindset and when you live in areas where

00:04:34.270 00:04:36.600
the air pollution is questionable or I

00:04:36.940 00:04:38.010
should say the air quality is

00:04:38.650 00:04:42.990
questionable and and then you have cars

00:04:43.870 00:04:46.920
okay and you have products that you put

00:04:47.050 00:04:48.840
on your skin and probably the products

00:04:48.940 00:04:51.180
that you use in your mouth and when

00:04:51.430 00:04:52.980
we're looking at everything that we're

00:04:54.150 00:04:57.180
consuming it's fair to say that the body

00:04:58.770 00:05:01.590
is reacting and we all know that a

00:05:02.020 00:05:03.780
reaction is an inflamed response right

00:05:04.000 00:05:07.260
when we react to something whether it's

00:05:07.570 00:05:09.570
a reaction of excitement or a reaction

00:05:09.970 00:05:13.130
of anger it's typically kind of

00:05:14.140 00:05:15.420
accelerated or it's exacerbated or I

00:05:17.280 00:05:19.830
mean I've lost my word there but anyway

00:05:19.990 00:05:22.620
but you get when it's it's emphasized as

00:05:22.930 00:05:24.780
another way I can say it so there's a

00:05:24.970 00:05:26.910
lot of enthusiasm regardless of its if

00:05:27.040 00:05:28.500
it's a good enthusiasm or a negative

00:05:29.410 00:05:30.500
enthusiasm there's a lot of enthusiasm

00:05:31.510 00:05:34.440
so that's what a reaction is if we

00:05:34.990 00:05:37.350
respond to something we come at it from

00:05:37.630 00:05:42.090
a more thoughtful way when I think about

00:05:42.520 00:05:45.870
human beings you know I can think of

00:05:46.240 00:05:47.670
nature nature truthfully in my opinion

00:05:48.280 00:05:50.190
responds as opposed to react but at the

00:05:50.380 00:05:52.590
same time there is a reaction and so

00:05:52.780 00:05:54.930
there's an inflamed response and so

00:05:55.450 00:05:56.940
typically so what I'm getting at here is

00:05:57.220 00:06:00.090
then when we are exposed to so much

00:06:00.940 00:06:02.550
there is an inflamed reaction in the

00:06:02.950 00:06:05.610
system and what that means is oxidation

00:06:06.130 00:06:07.710
we're breathing heavily or there's a lot

00:06:07.870 00:06:10.200
of oxygen coming in and those chemicals

00:06:10.660 00:06:13.890
are being metabolized rapidly in order

00:06:14.080 00:06:18.300
to produce and oxidative stress chemical

00:06:18.490 00:06:20.880
or reactive oxygen species or you know

00:06:21.430 00:06:22.230
anything that's considered an

00:06:22.770 00:06:24.180
inflammatory inflammatory marker

00:06:25.000 00:06:26.190
typically has a reason for being in the

00:06:26.350 00:06:27.810
body I've done videos on this as well

00:06:28.420 00:06:30.240
I've done it it's a lot of research on

00:06:31.180 00:06:33.600
these very chemicals because I have a

00:06:33.850 00:06:34.800
hard time believing that we produce

00:06:35.110 00:06:36.700
things that we don't need

00:06:36.979 00:06:38.800
maybe we don't need them forever or we

00:06:38.930 00:06:40.719
don't need them on an ongoing basis but

00:06:41.090 00:06:42.640
there's reason for it in the moment that

00:06:42.889 00:06:46.090
it's produced and so therefore I I spend

00:06:46.220 00:06:48.670
it a great deal of time digging into all

00:06:49.039 00:06:51.189
of these things and the purpose to that

00:06:51.830 00:06:53.620
the reason I'm even saying that here is

00:06:54.560 00:06:56.260
one of those particular substances is

00:06:56.840 00:06:58.689
referred to as neuro melanin and I may

00:06:58.850 00:07:01.439
not be pronouncing it properly you know

00:07:02.449 00:07:05.800
it's that's how it's spelled if somebody

00:07:06.080 00:07:07.270
said to me the other day I think it's

00:07:07.550 00:07:09.010
called neuro Millan and I'm like well

00:07:09.410 00:07:11.860
neuro melanin neuro melanin tomato

00:07:12.320 00:07:14.499
tomahto it's all the same the point is

00:07:14.660 00:07:18.310
that the sauce is a substance and found

00:07:18.470 00:07:19.990
in the substantia [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] which is a

00:07:20.990 00:07:22.210
section of the brain that is linked to

00:07:22.910 00:07:26.800
Parkinson's disease it is heavily a it's

00:07:27.520 00:07:30.070
where you should say a large portion of

00:07:30.259 00:07:35.080
our dopamine neurons are and and like I

00:07:35.150 00:07:36.909
said it is the part of the brain that is

00:07:37.400 00:07:40.089
is equal to motivation motor control

00:07:41.030 00:07:42.339
rewards so obviously there's dopamine

00:07:42.740 00:07:47.620
involved there but when dopamine is one

00:07:47.720 00:07:49.000
of the purposes of dopamine and I've

00:07:49.280 00:07:51.279
actually heard other clinicians say that

00:07:51.680 00:07:54.159
dopamine helps eliminate heavy metals

00:07:54.199 00:07:56.110
from the body let's just go on record

00:07:56.389 00:07:57.939
and say that the body does not have any

00:07:58.370 00:08:02.020
defined metal elimination system we

00:08:02.380 00:08:05.469
weren't we were not programmed to be in

00:08:05.840 00:08:07.450
such the environment that we are

00:08:07.759 00:08:10.149
currently in and we have yet to adapt to

00:08:10.310 00:08:14.620
it fully that said we do produce neural

00:08:15.139 00:08:18.969
melanin which is comes from the

00:08:19.490 00:08:21.790
breakdown of dopamine so the the

00:08:22.430 00:08:24.700
metabolism of dopamine goes into the

00:08:24.949 00:08:26.710
process of producing this other chemical

00:08:27.080 00:08:28.960
it is through like I had mentioned

00:08:29.150 00:08:31.659
earlier through Auto oxidation and the

00:08:32.180 00:08:33.969
reason for the substance is it gathers

00:08:34.760 00:08:37.659
the metals that are circulating and you

00:08:37.760 00:08:39.899
have crossed the blood-brain barrier and

00:08:40.909 00:08:43.360
it basically basically harvests them

00:08:43.789 00:08:46.870
it's a collection system

00:08:47.209 00:08:49.120
and then we end up storing it in the

00:08:49.370 00:08:51.850
brain and now we have high levels of

00:08:52.850 00:08:54.280
restless leg I can't tell you the number

00:08:54.350 00:08:55.660
of children that I work with that have

00:08:56.060 00:08:58.389
breasts legs I've also been diagnosed or

00:08:58.639 00:09:00.009
been told that they're living with ADHD

00:09:00.889 00:09:03.040
of course then there's autism we now

00:09:03.380 00:09:05.259
have early onset schizophrenia I mean it

00:09:05.360 00:09:09.269
used to be that schizophrenia was

00:09:10.279 00:09:12.309
basically diagnosed late teens early 20s

00:09:12.740 00:09:13.960
sometimes it was later in life but now

00:09:14.029 00:09:15.610
we have young children being diagnosed

00:09:15.829 00:09:18.069
with early onset schizophrenia I have to

00:09:18.259 00:09:19.660
say I've noticed that I'm shivering so

00:09:19.759 00:09:21.220
if it sounds like I'm stuttering that's

00:09:21.500 00:09:21.819
what it is

00:09:22.610 00:09:25.449
the air coming off this window is that

00:09:25.579 00:09:27.160
I'm sitting next to is incredibly cold

00:09:27.440 00:09:29.170
and I chose this window because of the

00:09:29.389 00:09:34.199
light so there you have it anyway

00:09:35.209 00:09:38.290
even mentioned there stuttering is when

00:09:38.480 00:09:39.879
it's chronic stuttering and some when it

00:09:40.519 00:09:43.090
actually comes from the very same area

00:09:43.940 00:09:46.540
which is it's it's linked to dopamine

00:09:47.500 00:09:53.019
and as is peg wedding and uresa says so

00:09:53.300 00:09:59.530
all of these conditions if you will all

00:10:00.319 00:10:09.210
stem from a very similar chemical

00:10:10.220 00:10:11.949
alteration I'm sorry I didn't want to go

00:10:12.230 00:10:14.350
for imbalance because as I see it

00:10:14.779 00:10:16.629
nature's in constant is in a constant

00:10:17.029 00:10:19.079
state of homeostasis are seeking

00:10:20.089 00:10:21.699
homeostasis we like to think that

00:10:21.920 00:10:25.840
balance is achievable but just as we

00:10:26.060 00:10:27.610
come into balance there's going to be

00:10:28.040 00:10:30.129
something else and so it's a constant

00:10:30.829 00:10:33.519
state of moving into homeostasis and

00:10:33.680 00:10:36.490
that is the nature of nature so I don't

00:10:36.889 00:10:39.340
believe in chemical imbalances like I

00:10:40.069 00:10:41.470
said earlier I've talked about it in the

00:10:41.750 00:10:44.769
past but as I dig through this more and

00:10:45.050 00:10:47.290
more I've come to see that it's really

00:10:47.449 00:10:49.120
just a matter of chemical adjustments

00:10:49.189 00:10:50.889
that are being made and again the neural

00:10:51.259 00:10:53.710
chemistry is required for other

00:10:54.230 00:10:56.110
processes in the system and so the body

00:10:56.240 00:10:58.260
has to break it down

00:10:58.360 00:11:00.360
in order to use it for other reasons and

00:11:01.060 00:11:03.000
in this case it's going more towards

00:11:03.820 00:11:05.340
oxidative stress which is the reason why

00:11:05.529 00:11:07.230
we are seeing so many degenerative

00:11:07.709 00:11:11.329
diseases neuro degeneration and so forth

00:11:12.339 00:11:14.579
so that's the reason for all the talk of

00:11:15.040 00:11:17.280
lemon and lavender and such because

00:11:17.620 00:11:19.470
there are very specific essential oils

00:11:20.200 00:11:23.280
that are known for their influence on

00:11:24.070 00:11:28.170
neuro chemistry and specific hormones so

00:11:28.360 00:11:30.060
it's not just neurotransmitters again

00:11:30.279 00:11:32.190
it's it's hormones and keep in mind some

00:11:32.320 00:11:33.810
of our neurotransmitters our kin are

00:11:34.510 00:11:36.269
considered hormones once they start

00:11:36.339 00:11:37.910
getting into other functions in the body

00:11:40.980 00:11:42.900
so essentially it's all chemical

00:11:43.420 00:11:45.570
messengers and essential oils have the

00:11:45.940 00:11:50.699
ability to influence that so it's very

00:11:51.459 00:11:53.699
important to know what you're using and

00:11:53.950 00:11:56.880
to really change it if I've ever said it

00:11:57.220 00:11:58.620
before I'm going to say it again it's

00:11:59.290 00:12:01.530
absolutely necessary to alter your oils

00:12:01.870 00:12:04.019
and not stick with the same thing and

00:12:04.870 00:12:06.510
that's a concern given the amount of

00:12:07.089 00:12:08.400
fragrance that we use and I realize

00:12:08.709 00:12:09.960
there's all kinds of things that we can

00:12:10.149 00:12:11.550
talk about that we need to be mindful of

00:12:11.829 00:12:14.579
but what I do know is that essential

00:12:14.800 00:12:17.850
oils are becoming increasingly popular

00:12:20.339 00:12:23.790
and nicely scented products I've seen a

00:12:24.520 00:12:26.639
household product with the word

00:12:27.459 00:12:28.620
aromatherapy attached to it whether or

00:12:28.839 00:12:31.230
just through advertising or even on the

00:12:31.630 00:12:35.810
labels themselves but there's a lot of

00:12:36.820 00:12:39.030
emphasis on the use of essential oils

00:12:39.160 00:12:40.949
and aromatherapy on a daily basis and

00:12:41.140 00:12:42.990
while I have great deal of appreciation

00:12:43.839 00:12:46.829
for that I'm here to say we need to be

00:12:47.079 00:12:48.900
careful with that because these

00:12:49.390 00:12:51.000
household products already contain such

00:12:51.339 00:12:53.460
things as xenoestrogens and other

00:12:54.040 00:12:55.829
chemicals that are affecting us and so

00:12:55.899 00:12:58.350
to add insult to injury by including the

00:12:58.690 00:13:00.230
oils and that these ever-popular

00:13:01.350 00:13:05.400
fragrances is actually not to our

00:13:05.440 00:13:08.250
advantage and at the same time if you're

00:13:08.589 00:13:11.490
using essential oils

00:13:12.220 00:13:13.620
separately you know whether it being a

00:13:14.080 00:13:17.190
diffuser or in a blend that you buy we

00:13:17.380 00:13:19.650
need to be understanding that again

00:13:19.960 00:13:22.770
these oils have very specific influences

00:13:22.990 00:13:25.800
on the neural chemistry and if you're

00:13:26.020 00:13:27.810
taking medications and let me just

00:13:28.120 00:13:30.540
remind us that over 50% of the US

00:13:30.880 00:13:32.700
population alone is taking some form of

00:13:33.210 00:13:35.700
psychotropic that's a huge amount of

00:13:36.930 00:13:40.200
people so to include essential oils with

00:13:40.480 00:13:42.720
that and knowing a psychotropic is

00:13:43.180 00:13:46.050
already affecting your um your neuro

00:13:46.740 00:13:49.710
chemistry you want to know that you're

00:13:50.560 00:13:52.140
helping to bring stabilization to the

00:13:52.330 00:13:53.100
body you're actually helping to

00:13:53.320 00:13:55.380
stabilize the system and not doing more

00:13:55.420 00:13:57.240
of the same thing and by that I mean

00:14:01.350 00:14:03.750
like if you're taking an end depressant

00:14:04.170 00:14:06.420
and you're including lemon oil in that

00:14:06.700 00:14:09.750
if you're taking an SSRI and you are

00:14:09.940 00:14:12.450
also using lemon oil you are really

00:14:12.790 00:14:15.020
throwing the system out of balance

00:14:16.030 00:14:18.510
meaning you're creating more of one

00:14:18.850 00:14:21.360
chemical which is going to cause other

00:14:22.060 00:14:23.280
adjustments to happen there is a ripple

00:14:23.770 00:14:26.270
effect and so if you're using an SSRI

00:14:27.280 00:14:28.500
you're gonna want to use something that

00:14:28.960 00:14:30.829
doesn't have any influence on the

00:14:31.839 00:14:34.110
serotonin or for that matter any of the

00:14:34.330 00:14:36.329
neuro chemistry you want to actually

00:14:36.970 00:14:38.760
support the digestive system you

00:14:39.220 00:14:44.300
actually want to help

00:14:47.700 00:14:50.000
maybe stabilize the immune system

00:14:51.010 00:14:52.500
because again those chemicals are also

00:14:52.870 00:14:55.260
used by the they also interact with the

00:14:55.570 00:14:57.480
immune system so kind of coming in from

00:14:58.480 00:15:00.440
supporting the digestive system and

00:15:01.450 00:15:03.930
really bringing a sense of stability to

00:15:04.060 00:15:06.000
the body so that would go back into more

00:15:06.070 00:15:09.000
of your grounding oils you know things

00:15:09.130 00:15:13.740
like myrrh and vetiver and benzoin and

00:15:14.230 00:15:17.070
again benzine is only advisable in some

00:15:17.530 00:15:18.949
cases your you know um

00:15:19.959 00:15:23.310
you're going to want to not use it in

00:15:23.530 00:15:25.770
conjunction with other

00:15:26.780 00:15:29.590
medications so a mindful application is

00:15:30.290 00:15:32.770
absolutely necessary now one of the

00:15:32.930 00:15:36.240
things I wanted to talk about also is a

00:15:37.250 00:15:42.880
statement for I guess where I was going

00:15:43.040 00:15:44.770
with all of that too was also just to

00:15:44.960 00:15:46.420
say that I can completely understand

00:15:46.520 00:15:49.030
when you take a broader picture I rather

00:15:49.310 00:15:53.500
look at what we're exposed to

00:15:54.350 00:15:56.620
environmentally and the level of stress

00:15:56.660 00:15:58.930
that we're experiencing on a daily basis

00:15:59.120 00:16:00.940
whether it be mental emotional and/or

00:16:01.570 00:16:04.720
environmental is the fact that there's

00:16:04.910 00:16:06.580
no mistaking why we have such things as

00:16:07.190 00:16:10.990
Parkinson's or Alzheimer's or ADHD or an

00:16:11.480 00:16:14.530
even including addiction having learned

00:16:14.990 00:16:17.260
everything I did from doing the the

00:16:17.540 00:16:19.810
recent video on lemon and especially the

00:16:19.850 00:16:22.180
the blog post that I did on lemon

00:16:22.310 00:16:24.400
essential oil and really coming to

00:16:24.890 00:16:26.140
understand dopamine at the level that I

00:16:26.920 00:16:30.100
did and I'm still I'm absolutely

00:16:30.650 00:16:32.200
fascinating but it cuz I will spend the

00:16:32.240 00:16:34.090
rest of today and who knows how long

00:16:34.630 00:16:36.850
pondering just really what's going on in

00:16:36.950 00:16:38.560
the brain I can completely understand

00:16:39.020 00:16:41.320
everyone's fascination with really

00:16:41.660 00:16:43.300
getting to understand what's going on

00:16:43.640 00:16:45.100
why it's happening and the various

00:16:45.470 00:16:47.440
levels of activity within the brain but

00:16:48.260 00:16:51.790
the honest-to-god truth is whether

00:16:52.130 00:16:55.180
you're involved with illicit drugs and

00:16:55.730 00:16:58.690
alcohol or you're just reaching for you

00:16:58.820 00:17:00.340
know these heavily caffeinated drinks

00:17:00.850 00:17:05.110
and really in indulging in the sugars I

00:17:05.600 00:17:08.860
got a phone call from a young man his

00:17:09.110 00:17:10.780
mother actually he was just recently

00:17:11.270 00:17:13.620
released from a treatment facility and

00:17:14.630 00:17:16.120
was being stabilized with medications

00:17:16.940 00:17:19.300
was doing very well we did put him on

00:17:19.490 00:17:21.160
some oils that supported the medications

00:17:21.440 00:17:22.840
and he was doing quite well and then all

00:17:22.880 00:17:26.290
of a sudden over the holidays he started

00:17:26.480 00:17:29.320
in his parents mind having a setback now

00:17:29.390 00:17:32.980
he was just treated for mental and

00:17:33.080 00:17:36.540
emotional instability there was no

00:17:40.020 00:17:42.960
as we have we would recognize going into

00:17:43.120 00:17:44.520
treatment for that I mean meaning there

00:17:44.800 00:17:47.250
wasn't any drugs or alcohol but since

00:17:47.560 00:17:51.230
then he's become very um hooked on

00:17:52.240 00:17:54.270
eating a lot of sugar and drinking

00:17:54.520 00:17:56.400
heavily caffeinated drinks now he's also

00:17:56.710 00:17:58.620
coming off some really strong medication

00:17:59.170 00:18:01.440
and so what I've had to explain to them

00:18:01.660 00:18:05.490
is that you can um it's no mistaking

00:18:06.370 00:18:08.850
given the area that he lives in given

00:18:09.280 00:18:10.950
the when he's exposed to and also

00:18:11.710 00:18:13.800
understand and keep in mind that the

00:18:13.990 00:18:16.400
neuro melanin that I mentioned actually

00:18:17.410 00:18:20.880
rapidly develops in the human brain very

00:18:21.340 00:18:22.980
early in life so we're talking child

00:18:23.350 00:18:25.890
young infancy to adolescence so that's

00:18:26.170 00:18:28.590
when the greatest development of neuro

00:18:29.280 00:18:32.160
melanin happens now it does continue on

00:18:33.100 00:18:34.380
throughout the rest of our lives but not

00:18:34.740 00:18:37.710
as significantly like it does in the

00:18:38.430 00:18:42.060
beginning and that just tells me now

00:18:42.280 00:18:43.860
that's just me but when I think of stuff

00:18:44.020 00:18:45.600
like that and I realized that the brain

00:18:45.910 00:18:49.740
is born into a with the body into a

00:18:50.140 00:18:52.650
world that all of a sudden is exposed to

00:18:53.020 00:18:54.720
all of these heavy metals and I realized

00:18:54.880 00:18:56.910
that these heavy metals and in this case

00:18:57.070 00:19:00.470
I'm talking iron manganese sulfur and

00:19:01.480 00:19:02.880
selenium those are the ones that are

00:19:03.220 00:19:06.390
typically found in neuro melanin these

00:19:06.610 00:19:08.910
are found there in our environment

00:19:09.100 00:19:11.010
already they're in there around us in

00:19:11.170 00:19:13.200
the natural world but we're using these

00:19:13.810 00:19:16.170
for other purposes and so therefore you

00:19:16.210 00:19:17.970
have a human body that's born into a

00:19:18.280 00:19:21.990
world and then boom exposed to them for

00:19:22.150 00:19:25.170
any number of reasons and it's gathering

00:19:25.630 00:19:27.240
in the brain and like I said the body

00:19:27.640 00:19:31.590
doesn't have a well-defined system for

00:19:31.960 00:19:33.090
eliminating heavy metals therefore it's

00:19:33.400 00:19:35.160
stored in the brain but if this is

00:19:35.770 00:19:40.440
happening on a regular basis okay if

00:19:40.630 00:19:42.450
this om you back up a minute if this is

00:19:43.120 00:19:46.680
happening early on in life and the

00:19:47.110 00:19:49.410
dopamine that's required for motivation

00:19:50.190 00:19:51.990
and reward

00:19:52.360 00:19:53.730
that is a good thing this is how we

00:19:54.220 00:19:56.430
learn and through life this is you know

00:19:56.740 00:19:58.080
there's a book there's a gonna be a

00:19:58.510 00:20:00.150
reward so there's a there's a reason for

00:20:00.310 00:20:06.560
this there's a positive for this process

00:20:07.570 00:20:09.660
so at any rate so there is a reason for

00:20:10.090 00:20:10.740
motivation and reward

00:20:11.590 00:20:13.050
in the mean time that chemical that's

00:20:13.600 00:20:17.600
required for that is being devoted

00:20:18.610 00:20:20.550
accentually to the development of neuro

00:20:21.010 00:20:22.620
melanin to the scavenging of these heavy

00:20:23.050 00:20:25.050
metals all right so which means we're

00:20:25.600 00:20:27.060
depleted in our dopamine so what's going

00:20:27.100 00:20:28.380
to happen with these children they're

00:20:28.480 00:20:29.880
gonna be agitated they're going to be

00:20:30.100 00:20:33.140
hyper sensitive they're going to show

00:20:34.150 00:20:35.190
stuttering there's gonna be bedwetting

00:20:35.470 00:20:36.960
there's gonna be a whole host of things

00:20:37.360 00:20:38.940
that are going on at a very early age

00:20:39.340 00:20:40.620
that's a very early sign that

00:20:41.050 00:20:42.780
something's happening in the brain now

00:20:43.210 00:20:44.640
can we stop this from happening I'd like

00:20:44.770 00:20:46.740
to say so but guess what it boils will

00:20:47.050 00:20:48.690
actually do that I understand there's a

00:20:48.730 00:20:52.920
lot of people out there that are doing

00:20:53.590 00:20:56.190
chelating agents and I can honestly tell

00:20:56.380 00:20:58.470
you that chelating agents actually help

00:20:58.840 00:21:01.110
remove metals from the blood they're not

00:21:01.750 00:21:03.090
necessarily a guarantee for the brain if

00:21:03.250 00:21:04.320
the brain is what we're looking to

00:21:04.920 00:21:07.170
protect then you're better option is an

00:21:07.630 00:21:09.540
essential oil straight up I'm not gonna

00:21:09.730 00:21:11.640
lie to you but at the same time we can

00:21:11.860 00:21:13.560
also understand why we're seeing

00:21:14.170 00:21:16.290
children get involved with eating a lot

00:21:16.330 00:21:18.420
of sugar it's not that they're weak it's

00:21:18.520 00:21:20.580
not bad parenting it is actually a form

00:21:20.680 00:21:22.830
of self-medication secondly there are

00:21:23.020 00:21:25.260
those who go for the chips and that

00:21:26.520 00:21:28.980
heavily processed foods because of you

00:21:29.080 00:21:30.810
know there's a lot of the omega sixes in

00:21:30.970 00:21:32.670
there we hear omega sixes are bad for us

00:21:33.190 00:21:35.250
no they're not they're good for us in in

00:21:36.250 00:21:37.380
proportion to the amount of Omega threes

00:21:37.660 00:21:39.750
there's actually a specific ratio that's

00:21:40.330 00:21:41.880
beneficial they're needed for hormonal

00:21:42.750 00:21:45.540
production that said they also activate

00:21:45.700 00:21:47.790
the endocannabinoid system ooh there we

00:21:48.070 00:21:51.300
go more self medication so is this a bad

00:21:51.340 00:21:54.150
thing no it is a sign that the body is

00:21:54.580 00:21:57.120
struggling and therefore would benefit

00:21:57.370 00:21:59.760
from the inclusion of essential oils

00:22:00.470 00:22:02.350
those that help with digestion those

00:22:02.570 00:22:05.230
that help with stabilizing the immune

00:22:05.660 00:22:07.030
system those that help us feel grounded

00:22:08.000 00:22:09.550
those ones that help us feel grounded

00:22:10.070 00:22:13.680
like frankincense and myrrh and vetiver

00:22:14.690 00:22:16.330
those particular oils and Roman

00:22:16.580 00:22:17.950
chamomile Roman chamomile would be

00:22:18.560 00:22:20.560
exceptional in this case because it

00:22:20.960 00:22:22.660
actually helps produce glutathione which

00:22:23.090 00:22:26.350
guess what helps to scavenge and protect

00:22:26.570 00:22:28.090
us from the heavy metals that and

00:22:28.760 00:22:30.990
magnesium so these are all ways to

00:22:32.000 00:22:34.810
address these symptoms as healthfully as

00:22:35.270 00:22:37.330
possible now again this isn't in lieu of

00:22:37.790 00:22:41.800
any medical assistance okay this is can

00:22:41.960 00:22:43.420
be in addition to or this can be in

00:22:43.610 00:22:45.130
early on this can be a more of a

00:22:45.910 00:22:47.770
preventive because let's face it we all

00:22:47.990 00:22:51.940
live on the same planet so all of that

00:22:52.460 00:22:55.000
said we can also now begin to see why

00:22:55.550 00:22:58.920
addiction develops okay we're

00:22:59.930 00:23:01.270
self-medicating maybe not all of you

00:23:01.700 00:23:04.690
approve of somebody's choice of drug you

00:23:04.850 00:23:07.090
know maybe a bag of chips to you is

00:23:07.400 00:23:10.470
better than you know cocaine okay that's

00:23:11.480 00:23:14.020
that's understandable because well

00:23:14.690 00:23:16.180
truthfully they both can lead to death

00:23:16.640 00:23:19.510
so let's be realistic and let's be kind

00:23:20.000 00:23:23.020
and let's just say that not everybody

00:23:23.600 00:23:25.840
chooses the same drug but the fact is is

00:23:26.030 00:23:28.240
that we're all self-medicating and we

00:23:28.460 00:23:31.420
can I given what I've under come to

00:23:32.000 00:23:35.140
understand just alone about dopamine in

00:23:35.210 00:23:38.770
the last week um two weeks has been

00:23:39.470 00:23:40.990
extraordinary and I'm excited to share

00:23:41.060 00:23:42.880
it here with you and all I want to say

00:23:43.130 00:23:45.190
is offer up if you are in fact

00:23:45.680 00:23:46.720
struggling like this young man been

00:23:47.060 00:23:49.210
reaching out for sugars and caffeine and

00:23:49.310 00:23:50.890
I'm having to give them some nutritional

00:23:51.200 00:23:52.420
advice because he's already got the oils

00:23:52.580 00:23:56.370
in place in order to offset this and

00:23:57.380 00:24:03.370
improve his level of ease and motivation

00:24:03.730 00:24:07.750
and feeling better so there is no

00:24:08.060 00:24:09.490
mistaking why any of this happens like I

00:24:09.770 00:24:11.290
said I mean our children are reaching

00:24:11.510 00:24:12.790
for foods that we don't necessary

00:24:13.570 00:24:16.600
prova but that's not their fault it's

00:24:16.820 00:24:19.240
not their fault it's it's just the world

00:24:19.430 00:24:21.250
that we live in and are we going to

00:24:21.470 00:24:23.170
clean it up any mo anytime soon

00:24:23.990 00:24:26.140
unfortunately not but we can actually

00:24:26.540 00:24:28.300
take care of our internal environment in

00:24:28.910 00:24:30.160
order to protect ourselves from the

00:24:30.470 00:24:33.580
external environment with the hope that

00:24:33.740 00:24:34.930
we're going to make a change outside of

00:24:35.060 00:24:36.550
ourselves because the fact is is that

00:24:36.710 00:24:40.390
our kids are coming in stressed and and

00:24:40.640 00:24:41.890
then it's become it gets increasingly

00:24:42.410 00:24:45.540
worse a reason a large another reason

00:24:46.550 00:24:47.830
another reason this is such a big deal

00:24:47.900 00:24:51.280
for me is because anxiety and autism and

00:24:51.470 00:24:56.340
ADHD and restless legs and addiction and

00:24:57.350 00:24:59.080
Parkinson's all run in my family

00:24:59.750 00:25:01.000
there isn't I don't know anyone in my

00:25:01.160 00:25:02.710
family that's not immune to something

00:25:03.080 00:25:06.610
along these lines so it's it hits home

00:25:06.800 00:25:09.400
with me I hope this makes sense if it

00:25:09.800 00:25:11.650
doesn't by all means let me know and

00:25:11.900 00:25:13.480
feel free to ask me additional questions

00:25:13.760 00:25:16.810
I am I just really want to hit home that

00:25:17.150 00:25:20.020
there is a great possibility for us here

00:25:20.960 00:25:24.550
it's just we have to I'm what my desire

00:25:24.590 00:25:26.620
is to shed light and actually see this

00:25:26.780 00:25:28.990
is not a dysfunction that this is a sign

00:25:29.030 00:25:32.080
that were that our systems are needing

00:25:32.500 00:25:34.840
help it's doing its best to keep us

00:25:35.000 00:25:37.300
protected but if we don't listen we will

00:25:37.490 00:25:40.540
get sick and with that I look forward to

00:25:40.730 00:25:41.140
hearing from you

00:25:41.270 00:25:43.000
I appreciate you watching and I hope

00:25:43.130 00:25:44.560
you're having a really beautiful day and

00:25:44.870 00:25:45.910
maybe a little bit warmer than I feel

00:25:46.070 00:25:47.800
right now but anyway thank you very much

00:25:48.350 00:25:51.400
I'll talk with you later bye
