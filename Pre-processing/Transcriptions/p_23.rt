00:00:00.269 00:00:01.670
the way I've been able to manage my

00:00:03.290 00:00:06.050
condition tells me by trial and error

00:00:06.960 00:00:10.129
there are no nothing the symptoms are

00:00:10.260 00:00:11.810
very different with different people

00:00:11.940 00:00:13.879
that are the same for example I don't

00:00:14.190 00:00:15.410
have problems swallowing somebody's

00:00:15.990 00:00:18.830
problem swallowing so in our pocket

00:00:19.020 00:00:20.779
since there were Parkinson's I was

00:00:21.150 00:00:22.700
warned by my new consultant that I came

00:00:22.980 00:00:25.429
here then it might increase the

00:00:25.590 00:00:29.210
medication is essential to control the

00:00:29.660 00:00:31.939
tremor but it has gone the side effect

00:00:32.040 00:00:34.940
of dyskinesia you see a body moves in

00:00:35.309 00:00:36.650
all sorts of directions without even

00:00:36.750 00:00:38.660
being able to control it if I turn

00:00:38.790 00:00:40.100
around quickly I have a fall because I

00:00:40.680 00:00:41.930
compounds myself my mind is not moving

00:00:42.120 00:00:45.069
and swiftly as my body in some cases

00:00:46.079 00:00:47.270
after what I've been through in my life

00:00:47.879 00:00:49.369
it is pretty easy for me to give up so

00:00:49.410 00:00:52.490
quickly on anything even in the morning

00:00:52.800 00:00:54.139
and I get him and try to do the buttons

00:00:54.270 00:00:56.799
up more my shirt I struggle a little

00:00:57.809 00:00:59.029
much keep telling myself you're not

00:00:59.219 00:01:01.069
going to beat me you got to be realistic

00:01:01.469 00:01:03.619
you know that you're slow down you know

00:01:03.930 00:01:06.530
that the people see you differently you

00:01:06.750 00:01:10.039
know that you are acting differently so

00:01:10.939 00:01:13.310
what my grandchildren are a great

00:01:14.070 00:01:15.649
motivating factor in the positive

00:01:15.930 00:01:17.749
thinking so without them I probably

00:01:17.970 00:01:19.280
would have survived this long since I

00:01:19.439 00:01:21.170
was diagnosed with Parkinson's really

00:01:21.990 00:01:24.280
have something to live for

00:01:25.290 00:01:27.590
looking continue raising some funds and

00:01:28.110 00:01:30.080
continue with our research I'm thinking

00:01:30.420 00:01:41.630
future generations really I live in hope
