00:00:01.879 00:00:04.700
hello my name is Glen Baskin sorry for

00:00:04.770 00:00:09.589
the camera shake but guess what I have

00:00:10.460 00:00:17.779
Parkinsons I've had it since 2011 have a

00:00:18.570 00:00:21.140
slight tremor because thankfully I

00:00:21.900 00:00:24.259
didn't take my third dose of Carlisle

00:00:24.630 00:00:29.179
edokko I take one in the morning and one

00:00:29.220 00:00:36.310
in the afternoon I try not to take a

00:00:37.320 00:00:40.340
afternoon dose because you take too much

00:00:40.950 00:00:44.779
Carl on the dope and you start suffer

00:00:44.850 00:00:48.380
from side effects you know like Michael

00:00:49.320 00:00:52.340
J Fox where he's twitching that's the

00:00:52.620 00:00:55.549
sign of it and stiffness and other

00:00:55.949 00:00:58.580
things I try to stay with more natural

00:00:59.129 00:01:09.370
things like Eco bolo

00:01:10.380 00:01:12.200
jazzy's Jasmine I think that's what it's

00:01:12.740 00:01:17.300
called magnesium lately I haven't had

00:01:17.430 00:01:19.940
the money to buy those things I noticed

00:01:20.100 00:01:21.429
the difference

00:01:23.109 00:01:28.090
tremors I try to do face exercise of

00:01:30.069 00:01:35.440
light may look funny but it keeps your

00:01:35.990 00:01:38.139
facial muscles strong because your

00:01:38.630 00:01:40.749
facial muscles get weak with Parkinsons

00:01:41.179 00:01:44.770
and that's where you get that lol like

00:01:45.259 00:01:48.429
Muhammad Ali's to look and you have to

00:01:48.590 00:01:53.339
keep fighting it I workout at the gym

00:01:54.349 00:01:56.649
five days a week this week I didn't work

00:01:56.840 00:01:59.919
out I had a sciatic nerve problems in my

00:02:00.200 00:02:03.010
back I thought I'd hurt my back but then

00:02:03.170 00:02:04.719
the doctor said it was just inflamed so

00:02:04.759 00:02:07.240
I took a week off but as you see I'm not

00:02:07.520 00:02:13.050
trying to brag this is from working out

00:02:14.060 00:02:16.360
five days a week and I've been doing

00:02:16.609 00:02:19.300
this since 2011 since I had Parkinson's

00:02:20.180 00:02:22.690
before I had Parkinson's I worked out

00:02:22.940 00:02:24.940
all the time so it was real easy to get

00:02:25.160 00:02:28.839
into because working out and your diet

00:02:29.599 00:02:34.050
and your natural herbs plus your

00:02:35.060 00:02:37.659
medications you get from your doctor but

00:02:37.940 00:02:38.949
you have to work that out with your

00:02:39.290 00:02:40.539
doctor let your doctor know whatever

00:02:40.940 00:02:43.659
you're taking how you taking it when

00:02:43.849 00:02:45.670
you're taking it and work with that

00:02:46.370 00:02:48.819
doctor and don't go get a regular

00:02:49.700 00:02:54.039
neurologist because they don't know what

00:02:54.260 00:02:55.690
they're doing a lot of them you should

00:02:56.030 00:02:59.830
get a movement specialist i believing a

00:03:00.470 00:03:03.069
specialist called dr. thomas in bedford

00:03:03.370 00:03:07.030
texas she's an awesome doctor she cares

00:03:07.430 00:03:10.690
she listens and she she's straight up

00:03:10.940 00:03:16.010
with you so I call this piece life

00:03:16.530 00:03:21.910
of a person with Parkinson's I have my

00:03:22.920 00:03:25.160
struggles I get embarrassed sometime

00:03:25.350 00:03:28.670
because my hand shakes especially when I

00:03:28.800 00:03:30.710
get nervous it happens to me at work

00:03:30.960 00:03:33.740
when the pressure of the job it's me I

00:03:34.500 00:03:39.560
seem to shake more but you know the

00:03:39.720 00:03:43.250
people I work with accept me as I am

00:03:43.830 00:03:46.120
they know what's going on with me and

00:03:47.130 00:03:51.500
the place I work at management staff are

00:03:55.340 00:03:57.650
very nice to me and they know what's

00:03:57.840 00:04:01.880
going on with me but I never had any

00:04:02.820 00:04:05.180
problems so like I said I've had it

00:04:05.340 00:04:10.010
since 2011 I know I noticed when I

00:04:10.620 00:04:13.970
workout and get tired I shake more so

00:04:14.310 00:04:15.380
after I get through with my workout I

00:04:15.720 00:04:17.150
come to work my hands shaking a little

00:04:17.430 00:04:19.789
more because I've brought myself to

00:04:20.489 00:04:24.110
exhaustion because I work out but that

00:04:24.780 00:04:27.650
exhaustion helps because your muscles

00:04:29.210 00:04:31.550
weaken because of Parkinson's so you

00:04:32.340 00:04:34.790
have to fight to keep it strong that's

00:04:35.480 00:04:40.010
why you should not give up when you hear

00:04:40.170 00:04:44.720
your diagnosis I know it's a devastating

00:04:45.300 00:04:50.450
thing to happen to you and you worry

00:04:50.810 00:04:53.570
about what are you gonna be like down

00:04:53.850 00:04:59.690
the road you know my I guess we're stars

00:04:59.940 00:05:02.510
not by my about me but about my children

00:05:02.730 00:05:06.950
I don't want to be a burden so that's

00:05:07.140 00:05:10.440
why I keep myself strong

00:05:10.750 00:05:12.840
and workout I won't flip over it he will

00:05:13.060 00:05:19.050
show you so I guess I can't flip the

00:05:19.270 00:05:21.780
camera over while I'm talking so I'm

00:05:21.970 00:05:24.240
gonna had to get up turning toward you

00:05:24.490 00:05:35.700
but I keep this mat on the floor my man

00:05:36.130 00:05:43.350
I do sit-ups I have light weight so when

00:05:43.480 00:05:47.540
I'm sitting around I don't sit around I

00:05:48.550 00:05:52.800
don't sit around and do nothing because

00:05:53.620 00:05:55.500
the Parkinson's is fighting to take over

00:05:55.660 00:05:58.470
my muscles so I sit here especially on

00:05:58.630 00:06:01.080
the right side and just this is a

00:06:01.690 00:06:04.050
five-pound weight as you see they say

00:06:04.330 00:06:05.280
that's show it to you

00:06:05.340 00:06:11.610
I forgot I can't flip the camera or five

00:06:11.980 00:06:13.440
pound range you just need a light weight

00:06:13.960 00:06:20.120
and just do curls just like curl

00:06:21.690 00:06:23.520
shoulders if you lay on the floor and

00:06:23.860 00:06:25.950
you get another one go straight up that

00:06:26.230 00:06:28.800
works in your chest muscles and most of

00:06:28.960 00:06:33.900
all work on your legs walk run if you

00:06:34.950 00:06:38.400
can do leg exercise if you can't and the

00:06:38.680 00:06:45.990
most important thing is right here your

00:06:47.400 00:06:49.710
core you have to keep your core strong

00:06:50.020 00:06:52.560
you have to do sit-ups you only can do

00:06:52.930 00:06:56.070
one set up today do one if you can't if

00:06:56.170 00:06:59.940
you can do if you can do more d2 we keep

00:07:00.610 00:07:04.950
building up because Parkinson's weakens

00:07:05.110 00:07:11.480
your core I can't think of anything else

00:07:12.490 00:07:16.140
constipation I found out that uh taking

00:07:18.890 00:07:24.520
died of fiber powder fiber then I found

00:07:24.680 00:07:31.270
this great mixture of magnesium and it

00:07:31.580 00:07:34.570
keeps me regular because the moment I

00:07:34.760 00:07:37.000
get away from it I get constipated and

00:07:40.010 00:07:42.550
trying to think of anything else but

00:07:42.620 00:07:46.930
right now today day 1 of life with a

00:07:47.210 00:07:50.050
person with Parkinson's a life with

00:07:50.419 00:07:52.570
Glenn with Parkinson's I guess maybe

00:07:52.730 00:07:53.980
that's why I should call it and I posted

00:07:54.140 00:07:58.690
on YouTube there's hope for us and most

00:07:58.820 00:08:00.760
of all when you find out you got it you

00:08:00.950 00:08:03.850
just can't lay around and decide you're

00:08:04.040 00:08:05.980
not gonna walk anymore you're not gonna

00:08:06.200 00:08:07.450
do anything you're not gonna fight you

00:08:07.700 00:08:10.330
have to fight because this is this

00:08:10.910 00:08:14.860
disease is fighting against you you

00:08:15.320 00:08:16.870
understand it's fighting against you

00:08:17.540 00:08:19.210
it's trying its best to deteriorate your

00:08:19.700 00:08:22.180
body and you have to fight back but

00:08:22.880 00:08:25.600
exercise diet or herbal medications and

00:08:26.360 00:08:27.520
work with your doctor on the

00:08:27.850 00:08:31.600
prescription medications you know you

00:08:32.030 00:08:33.790
can't try everything in the world for it

00:08:34.599 00:08:40.709
but the ginkgo bollo and Jasmine and

00:08:41.719 00:08:46.120
magnesium has helped me a lot and that's

00:08:46.370 00:08:47.620
why I'm shaking a little bit more than

00:08:47.960 00:08:52.180
normal because I I I didn't buy any for

00:08:52.280 00:08:53.920
the last couple of months and I noticed

00:08:54.080 00:08:58.540
the difference so all I can say right

00:08:59.150 00:09:03.460
now to use fight don't give up this is

00:09:03.800 00:09:09.700
Glen Baskin and I just call this life of

00:09:09.800 00:09:12.920
a person with Parkinson's

00:09:13.980 00:09:17.820
fight don't give up
