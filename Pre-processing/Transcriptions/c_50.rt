00:00:00.030 00:00:02.149
a friend graham cochran here you know

00:00:02.310 00:00:03.740
what the number one reason I hear from

00:00:03.959 00:00:05.690
people for why they can't start the

00:00:06.060 00:00:07.220
business or they're not able to grow

00:00:07.440 00:00:08.600
their business to where they want to be

00:00:09.090 00:00:12.080
number one reason lack of time all of us

00:00:12.269 00:00:14.120
are busy and they're all legitimate

00:00:14.670 00:00:16.400
reasons we're working a day job or

00:00:17.070 00:00:17.840
nine-to-five we're trying to raise a

00:00:18.150 00:00:19.340
family or we're going to school

00:00:19.680 00:00:21.170
full-time or we work two or three jobs

00:00:21.810 00:00:24.320
and so that just never seems to be

00:00:24.630 00:00:27.859
enough time to start a business even if

00:00:27.990 00:00:30.019
you have all the information and the

00:00:30.570 00:00:32.959
strategy and the idea you might just be

00:00:33.210 00:00:34.490
looking at your schedule and saying I

00:00:34.649 00:00:37.549
don't have any space to do this in now

00:00:37.739 00:00:39.590
while this might be true trying to

00:00:40.260 00:00:42.500
create more time in your schedule isn't

00:00:42.719 00:00:44.840
the only solution on the table taking

00:00:45.300 00:00:48.470
less time to do the work is and it's a

00:00:48.809 00:00:50.930
better solution primarily because this

00:00:51.090 00:00:52.340
is the only part of the equation that's

00:00:53.039 00:00:54.889
really in your control in fact by

00:00:55.469 00:00:56.990
hacking something called Parkinson's law

00:00:57.840 00:00:59.660
you and I can actually get more done in

00:00:59.789 00:01:02.270
our businesses in less time let me

00:01:02.550 00:01:03.799
explain what I mean if we want to get

00:01:04.170 00:01:06.800
more work done in less time then it

00:01:06.960 00:01:08.690
would help to better understand the

00:01:09.420 00:01:11.810
reality of work the way work actually

00:01:12.510 00:01:13.910
works and we do this by understanding

00:01:14.880 00:01:16.310
something called Parkinson's law

00:01:17.250 00:01:19.990
Parkinson's law states that work expands

00:01:21.000 00:01:23.539
so as to fill the time available for its

00:01:24.090 00:01:26.590
completion did you catch that work

00:01:27.600 00:01:30.560
expands it always expands and it will

00:01:31.140 00:01:32.990
expand to fit whatever time you've

00:01:33.659 00:01:35.810
allotted for its completion and this is

00:01:35.850 00:01:38.539
a powerful concept if we wrap our heads

00:01:38.700 00:01:40.370
around it you give something a certain

00:01:40.500 00:01:42.679
amount of time it will take that amount

00:01:42.810 00:01:45.410
of time it will expand and fill up every

00:01:45.780 00:01:47.929
crack every inch every ounce of space

00:01:48.240 00:01:50.139
you've give it now we know this is true

00:01:51.149 00:01:52.249
because we've all had that experience

00:01:52.860 00:01:54.170
where you've had to get something done

00:01:54.240 00:01:56.060
in less time I think back to when I was

00:01:56.130 00:01:58.819
in college and even on high school I was

00:01:58.860 00:02:01.160
a procrastinator maybe I still am but I

00:02:01.530 00:02:03.260
would be given a school project and I'd

00:02:03.420 00:02:04.999
be given 30 days to complete that

00:02:05.280 00:02:08.479
project okay what would I do I would

00:02:08.670 00:02:10.309
wait till the very last minute

00:02:10.979 00:02:12.500
generally the day before it was due

00:02:12.659 00:02:14.600
maybe two days before and in a panic I

00:02:14.939 00:02:16.190
realized oh my gosh these projects do

00:02:16.920 00:02:17.990
I've had a whole month to do it I

00:02:18.450 00:02:20.000
haven't done anything I gotta get it

00:02:20.129 00:02:23.330
done so what I ended up doing was making

00:02:23.489 00:02:25.610
it happen and getting it done somehow

00:02:26.519 00:02:28.759
someway with a passing grade so I'm

00:02:29.129 00:02:30.380
given a month to do something but I

00:02:30.569 00:02:31.850
actually get it done in a day

00:02:32.069 00:02:34.160
why because I only allowed myself a day

00:02:34.230 00:02:36.289
to do it I had to get it done and we

00:02:36.450 00:02:38.210
know this with unimportant tasks too if

00:02:38.340 00:02:40.190
I gave you the whole day to write an

00:02:40.709 00:02:42.229
important email to someone you wanted to

00:02:42.390 00:02:43.910
reach out to and influence or let's say

00:02:44.549 00:02:46.970
you would take the whole day to draft up

00:02:47.129 00:02:48.619
this amazing email and make sure it's

00:02:48.690 00:02:50.780
perfect but if I gave you only an hour's

00:02:50.940 00:02:51.949
and you got to write this email in an

00:02:52.079 00:02:53.180
hour because you got other stuff to do

00:02:53.489 00:02:55.520
you would somehow get that email written

00:02:55.889 00:02:58.099
in an hour and it would likely be just

00:02:58.260 00:03:00.500
as good why because when you have to

00:03:00.659 00:03:03.649
deliver we deliver we get focused you

00:03:03.810 00:03:06.170
see once you understand that how long

00:03:06.780 00:03:08.539
something takes to complete is greatly

00:03:09.480 00:03:11.720
influenced by how much time you allow it

00:03:11.760 00:03:14.690
to take then it puts you in the driver's

00:03:14.730 00:03:17.119
seat giving you the most powerful tool

00:03:17.489 00:03:20.270
at your disposal which is a short and

00:03:20.609 00:03:21.949
tight deadline you see there's something

00:03:22.709 00:03:24.890
magic about looking at your task and

00:03:25.169 00:03:26.960
giving it an impossibly short deadline

00:03:27.780 00:03:29.449
instantly you become focused you

00:03:30.120 00:03:31.430
immediately shed all the extraneous

00:03:32.310 00:03:34.400
tasks that aren't important or critical

00:03:34.650 00:03:36.229
and you begin cooking up ways to get

00:03:36.389 00:03:38.569
this thing done as efficiently and as

00:03:38.970 00:03:41.750
fast as possible all because you have to

00:03:41.970 00:03:44.270
and since we also know that 80% of the

00:03:44.730 00:03:46.580
tasks that we do don't really contribute

00:03:46.769 00:03:48.800
much to the final outcome without even

00:03:49.470 00:03:51.589
realizing it we begin shedding that 80%

00:03:52.470 00:03:55.189
and focusing on the 20% that really will

00:03:55.230 00:03:56.659
make the difference and get this thing

00:03:56.730 00:03:58.280
done in fact that's one way that

00:03:58.919 00:04:01.460
Parkinson's law can be really hacked to

00:04:01.620 00:04:03.890
its fullest potential is by pairing it

00:04:03.930 00:04:06.470
with the 8020 rule I think this was best

00:04:07.349 00:04:09.080
explained by Tim Ferriss in his book

00:04:09.449 00:04:10.490
4-hour workweek which I've already

00:04:10.949 00:04:13.129
reviewed here but you take these two

00:04:13.769 00:04:15.890
concepts the 8020 rule and Parkinson's

00:04:16.079 00:04:17.899
Law and put them in concert and you

00:04:18.269 00:04:20.509
create massive amount of focus and

00:04:20.969 00:04:23.480
efficiency in your work if 80% of what

00:04:23.700 00:04:26.030
you do doesn't really contribute to

00:04:26.400 00:04:28.100
the final outcome then you can stop

00:04:28.590 00:04:30.200
doing 80% of the tasks those frees up

00:04:30.240 00:04:32.450
time and then if you give yourself tight

00:04:32.880 00:04:35.090
short deadlines on the remaining 20% it

00:04:35.550 00:04:38.090
forces you to ignore the 80% as well and

00:04:38.670 00:04:41.150
they work together in concert making you

00:04:41.490 00:04:43.580
become efficient and focus and create

00:04:44.220 00:04:46.340
massive output in minimal amount of time

00:04:46.830 00:04:48.410
so how does this all work practically

00:04:48.660 00:04:49.910
let me give you some examples of how I'm

00:04:50.190 00:04:52.250
using Parkinson's law in my own business

00:04:52.830 00:04:55.010
number one I take Friday's off every

00:04:55.320 00:04:57.530
single week so I immediately remove an

00:04:57.930 00:04:59.960
entire day that would be available to me

00:05:00.000 00:05:02.120
to work creating a false time crunch I

00:05:02.370 00:05:04.670
just have to get everything done between

00:05:04.890 00:05:07.430
Monday and Thursday and somehow in the

00:05:07.650 00:05:09.020
last nine years straight I've been able

00:05:09.120 00:05:10.820
to get everything done between Monday

00:05:11.160 00:05:13.250
and Thursday why because I have to

00:05:13.980 00:05:15.410
secondly I create a false time crunch in

00:05:15.540 00:05:17.420
my work days so instead of working in

00:05:17.610 00:05:19.610
full eight nine ten hour day some of us

00:05:19.800 00:05:21.890
are working 14-hour days I give myself

00:05:22.080 00:05:24.230
only five hours so I

00:05:24.480 00:05:26.600
I immediately forced myself to clock out

00:05:26.790 00:05:28.250
by two o'clock I come in the office at

00:05:28.440 00:05:30.710
9:00 a.m. and my firm clock out time is

00:05:31.140 00:05:34.220
2:00 p.m. and that means I kind of have

00:05:34.380 00:05:36.740
to put my phone away not respond to

00:05:37.380 00:05:40.460
texts not check email not get lost on

00:05:40.710 00:05:42.860
Twitter I only have five hours to do

00:05:43.050 00:05:44.540
what I need to do today and I already

00:05:44.820 00:05:46.460
take Friday's off as well so there's

00:05:46.590 00:05:48.440
this extra time crunch and I become

00:05:49.050 00:05:50.870
focused and I just create my content I

00:05:51.420 00:05:52.970
build my products interact with

00:05:53.400 00:05:54.770
customers and students I do what I have

00:05:54.990 00:05:56.990
to do and I do it quickly and thirdly I

00:05:57.210 00:05:59.330
use Parkinson's law by ordering what I

00:05:59.460 00:06:01.520
do I make sure that I do the most

00:06:02.280 00:06:04.460
important thing in my day first thing in

00:06:04.560 00:06:06.710
the morning if I get that done first

00:06:07.260 00:06:08.300
then it almost doesn't matter how the

00:06:08.520 00:06:09.950
rest of the day goes because the most

00:06:10.320 00:06:11.870
important thing is done so what this

00:06:12.090 00:06:13.910
means for me practically is I never ever

00:06:14.610 00:06:16.040
start my day with email and you

00:06:16.350 00:06:16.610
shouldn't either

00:06:17.040 00:06:18.830
email is a time suck email is other

00:06:20.090 00:06:21.740
people dictating what you should be

00:06:22.140 00:06:24.080
doing in your day and that's not the way

00:06:24.120 00:06:25.850
to be effective or productive you should

00:06:26.190 00:06:28.130
ignore email get into your office and

00:06:28.860 00:06:30.650
get the most important thing done in the

00:06:30.870 00:06:32.900
first hour or two you can check email

00:06:33.180 00:06:35.300
later it will go faster then but this is

00:06:35.340 00:06:37.430
a huge way I use Parkinson's laws I have

00:06:37.590 00:06:38.510
to get this done

00:06:38.610 00:06:39.950
and make sure I'm not distracted by

00:06:40.020 00:06:41.990
things that become open-ended like my

00:06:42.330 00:06:44.659
email inbox so in reality the truth is

00:06:44.879 00:06:47.659
there will always be more work to do for

00:06:48.659 00:06:50.689
even outside those work hours and all of

00:06:50.819 00:06:52.490
it could possibly move the business

00:06:52.680 00:06:54.350
forward increase sales increase growth

00:06:54.720 00:06:57.559
but since I want a life and not just a

00:06:57.960 00:07:01.219
business I carve out the time I leverage

00:07:01.860 00:07:03.860
Parkinson's Law and I get as much done

00:07:03.900 00:07:06.200
as I possibly can in as little time as

00:07:06.539 00:07:08.869
possible and if time is even tighter in

00:07:09.030 00:07:10.939
your schedule new or super busy then

00:07:11.340 00:07:13.790
this concept of Parkinson's Law is of

00:07:14.159 00:07:15.379
even more importance for you

00:07:15.780 00:07:18.860
work always expands to fill the time you

00:07:19.050 00:07:22.249
give it so just give it less time and

00:07:22.409 00:07:24.559
you'll get everything done faster now I

00:07:24.780 00:07:26.330
want to hear from you what is one way

00:07:27.030 00:07:29.029
that you could implement Parkinson's law

00:07:29.340 00:07:31.879
in your business and life in the next 30

00:07:31.979 00:07:33.589
days leave a comment below let me know

00:07:33.840 00:07:35.059
