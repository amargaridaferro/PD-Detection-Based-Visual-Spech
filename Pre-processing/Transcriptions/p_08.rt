hi I'm Marcy I'm 38 and I have

00:00:04.980 00:00:07.579
Parkinson's and I've had it since I was

00:00:07.950 00:00:10.940
32 and I had degrade simulation done on

00:00:11.099 00:00:12.620
my right side of my head so it affects

00:00:12.780 00:00:17.810
my left side my body so it also affects

00:00:17.940 00:00:20.000
my walking too so I still occasionally

00:00:20.580 00:00:24.380
takes intimate today is the 9th of May

00:00:25.519 00:00:29.480
and May 16th I had my left side of my

00:00:29.730 00:00:31.730
brain done to affect my right side my

00:00:32.219 00:00:35.840
dominant side so it's weird how

00:00:36.420 00:00:40.369
Parkinson's works for me the more I try

00:00:40.410 00:00:42.110
to concentrate on something else like

00:00:42.600 00:00:44.900
talking my handshake more the gardening

00:00:45.120 00:00:47.150
is very therapeutic because you can

00:00:47.579 00:00:48.709
concentrate on a weed and can pick it

00:00:49.430 00:00:51.229
and planning seeds

00:00:51.390 00:00:53.119
I'm very impressed on how my hands stop

00:00:53.520 00:00:55.160
shaking when I do that because it's one

00:00:55.739 00:00:59.569
focused thought and date and nothing

00:00:59.730 00:01:02.420
else on my mind in a work sweet so let

00:01:02.550 00:01:06.410
me show you my garden one reason another

00:01:06.510 00:01:08.420
reason I'm motivated to do a garden is

00:01:09.619 00:01:13.700
one organic reasons my father worked out

00:01:13.740 00:01:20.030
a fertilizer plant and head toxin or

00:01:20.759 00:01:22.640
pesticide herbicides on his clothes on

00:01:22.830 00:01:24.920
his work truck I'd even go to his work

00:01:25.170 00:01:28.429
and climbed fertilizer mound so it was

00:01:28.560 00:01:30.980
pretty bad that's how I work there's a

00:01:31.680 00:01:33.380
genetic component to of Parkinson's in

00:01:33.450 00:01:36.950
my family my maternal grandfather had it

00:01:38.270 00:01:41.899
and my dad's side had tremors central

00:01:43.130 00:01:47.080
tremors not too bad though mostly my

00:01:48.090 00:01:48.950
mom's side of the family

00:01:49.549 00:01:54.139
the her father and then what scary for

00:01:54.270 00:01:58.819
my kids is my ex-husband his dad had

00:01:59.130 00:02:01.429
Parkinson's and he died at 61 and was

00:02:01.979 00:02:06.100
diagnosed at 28 so I was diagnosed at 32

00:02:07.110 00:02:08.240
knee was much more active and healthy

00:02:08.369 00:02:10.490
but he refused to have deep brain

00:02:12.290 00:02:14.410
he worked for Medtronic and design

00:02:15.670 00:02:17.680
pacemakers he took the medication route

00:02:18.760 00:02:22.150
which me medication when you're younger

00:02:22.940 00:02:25.770
on Ted it affects doesn't last long and

00:02:26.780 00:02:28.030
you start to develop this Conejo so

00:02:28.190 00:02:29.820
that's what is almost more painful and

00:02:30.830 00:02:35.620
debilitating I've had fallen more with

00:02:35.870 00:02:37.360
the dyskinesias which is twisting and

00:02:37.430 00:02:39.490
turning my foot so if you look at some

00:02:39.620 00:02:42.880
