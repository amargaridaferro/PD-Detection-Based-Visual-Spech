00:00:03.330 00:00:04.880
hi I'm dawn from the blog dueling

00:00:05.220 00:00:06.800
designs and that close to that sewing

00:00:07.020 00:00:08.780
blab and we're going to talk about

00:00:09.300 00:00:11.540
pattern making books today I used to do

00:00:12.389 00:00:14.419
kind of a series on periscope where we

00:00:14.610 00:00:15.919
would look at different pattern

00:00:16.619 00:00:17.779
manipulations so at first we talked

00:00:18.230 00:00:21.109
about darts then we did some collars and

00:00:21.570 00:00:23.599
I was gonna do cuffs and sleeves and

00:00:24.029 00:00:25.400
pockets and all that it was a lot of fun

00:00:25.529 00:00:26.599
it was so neat having an interaction

00:00:27.060 00:00:29.029
with everyone so I was trying to think

00:00:29.099 00:00:31.400
of a way to how to do that on YouTube so

00:00:31.529 00:00:32.720
I'm gonna start this new series on

00:00:33.600 00:00:34.790
pattern meant making and pattern

00:00:35.489 00:00:36.770
manipulations on this YouTube channel

00:00:37.649 00:00:40.639
now this one is just a pattern review so

00:00:40.680 00:00:41.869
I kind of have a thing for pattern

00:00:42.059 00:00:44.270
making sewing I like but pattern making

00:00:44.550 00:00:47.150
I love I love the puzzle of it all so I

00:00:47.370 00:00:48.619
have quite a few pattern making books

00:00:48.809 00:00:50.180
which I quite enjoy so I thought we

00:00:50.399 00:00:51.979
talked about some of them today the

00:00:52.379 00:00:54.500
first pattern making book I ever got was

00:00:55.320 00:00:56.540
when I went to mass the University

00:00:56.789 00:00:58.250
this was our textbook this is an older

00:00:58.710 00:01:00.709
edition it's a fourth edition this is

00:01:00.989 00:01:03.049
pattern making for fashion design by

00:01:03.660 00:01:06.200
Helen Joseph Armstrong and it is great

00:01:06.810 00:01:08.060
for beginners it has a lot of

00:01:08.369 00:01:09.620
information in it so we're gonna do a

00:01:09.840 00:01:12.230
book review on this book today I will

00:01:12.600 00:01:14.000
review other pattern making books in the

00:01:14.310 00:01:18.200
future like Winfred Alex book it is a

00:01:18.659 00:01:20.240
pattern metric pattern cutting for

00:01:20.549 00:01:21.770
women's wear and there's a whole series

00:01:21.990 00:01:22.999
of these and they're very interesting

00:01:23.310 00:01:24.950
this was the second book that I got for

00:01:25.229 00:01:27.020
pattern making but even between these

00:01:27.270 00:01:29.060
two there's quite a little bit of a jump

00:01:29.759 00:01:30.830
so what I want to do is to make sure

00:01:30.990 00:01:33.170
that you know where you are in pattern

00:01:33.360 00:01:36.219
making if you have the right book

00:01:37.229 00:01:39.169
so why should you do your own pattern

00:01:39.539 00:01:41.389
making even if it's just manipulating a

00:01:41.719 00:01:44.419
caller well it makes things more unique

00:01:44.729 00:01:46.520
it makes them designs more yours and it

00:01:46.770 00:01:48.529
makes them fit those are great reasons

00:01:48.990 00:01:50.569
to start even if you just dabble in

00:01:50.880 00:01:52.819
pattern making there's two reasons that

00:01:53.100 00:01:54.350
you might want to buy one of these books

00:01:55.229 00:01:56.630
one is if you want to make clothing

00:01:57.030 00:01:58.819
using your own measurements to make

00:01:59.159 00:02:01.459
blocks to therefore use those blocks to

00:02:01.530 00:02:03.319
make any kind of patterns you might want

00:02:04.229 00:02:06.289
the second one is and this is great for

00:02:07.350 00:02:08.719
maybe you've been sewing for a while and

00:02:08.819 00:02:10.100
you make a lot of bought patterns

00:02:10.440 00:02:12.050
whether they're the cool indie patterns

00:02:12.239 00:02:14.890
or the fabulous big four like McCall's

00:02:15.900 00:02:17.479
well maybe you want to change the collar

00:02:18.180 00:02:19.970
maybe you want to move the waist maybe

00:02:20.130 00:02:21.380
you want to make it sleeveless and it's

00:02:21.540 00:02:23.569
not a sleeveless design these are the

00:02:23.790 00:02:25.039
sort of books that can help you to take

00:02:25.379 00:02:27.680
those patterns and manipulate them into

00:02:27.900 00:02:30.080
something new and unique or shrinking

00:02:30.450 00:02:33.140
pattern them just a thing to know not

00:02:33.360 00:02:34.580
all of them pattern making books that

00:02:34.709 00:02:36.619
I'm going to review allow you to make

00:02:36.959 00:02:38.750
blocks they don't have a section that

00:02:39.299 00:02:41.420
lets you take your measurements and then

00:02:41.609 00:02:43.370
make a block and then use that block to

00:02:43.500 00:02:45.319
make all the pattern manipulations some

00:02:45.480 00:02:46.670
of them only start with pattern

00:02:47.459 00:02:49.550
manipulations so it depends if you're

00:02:49.739 00:02:53.449
already using a block or a pattern and

00:02:53.940 00:02:55.280
then making the manipulations or if you

00:02:55.500 00:02:57.470
want to start from scratch I'll feature

00:02:57.930 00:02:59.180
lots of different pattern making books

00:02:59.400 00:03:01.789
in this series but it's important to

00:03:01.980 00:03:03.650
note that summer for more for beginners

00:03:03.900 00:03:05.240
and others are more for advanced people

00:03:05.849 00:03:07.220
for example already mentioned the one

00:03:07.380 00:03:08.479
we're going to talk about today is

00:03:09.319 00:03:11.479
definitely beginner friendly very very

00:03:11.669 00:03:13.370
very friendly there are others out there

00:03:13.560 00:03:15.229
that are beginner friendly that will do

00:03:15.750 00:03:18.740
some book reviews on and then there's

00:03:18.989 00:03:21.379
also some that are a bit kind of

00:03:21.989 00:03:23.500
middle-of-the-road that we'll discuss

00:03:25.099 00:03:28.039
whoops and we'll also discuss some of

00:03:28.139 00:03:30.170
the more advanced ones what makes them a

00:03:30.419 00:03:31.580
little bit more advanced like some of

00:03:31.680 00:03:34.400
the pattern magic series is that they

00:03:34.620 00:03:36.710
don't give step-by-step instructions for

00:03:37.290 00:03:38.960
every little thing they give you a few

00:03:39.209 00:03:40.789
instructions but some things they just

00:03:41.400 00:03:43.490
kind of expect that you have some

00:03:43.799 00:03:46.160
knowledge and will be able to make some

00:03:46.200 00:03:48.630
of these fabulous things

00:03:49.640 00:03:50.860
just by seeing where the lines are

00:03:51.440 00:03:52.720
there's a little bit more play in there

00:03:53.390 00:03:55.240
as well as more advanced books like this

00:03:55.310 00:03:57.430
one which does the same thing it has a

00:03:57.680 00:04:01.030
lot more advanced pattern making that

00:04:01.160 00:04:02.440
you probably don't want to tackle right

00:04:02.600 00:04:03.699
out of the gate or you might get very

00:04:04.520 00:04:06.160
discouraged even within a series there

00:04:06.320 00:04:07.960
can be quite a bit of difference between

00:04:08.360 00:04:09.940
one book and another and the level of

00:04:10.340 00:04:12.430
difficulty for example the first one in

00:04:12.680 00:04:15.160
this series fashion pattern making

00:04:15.620 00:04:17.860
techniques is it's pretty easy to follow

00:04:18.049 00:04:19.720
they give you enough instructions that

00:04:19.910 00:04:21.280
you can definitely make a lot of the

00:04:21.470 00:04:23.130
things that are in here without having

00:04:24.140 00:04:26.710
pattern made for years whereas the one

00:04:26.900 00:04:28.180
in the next part of the series the whole

00:04:28.630 00:04:31.990
Couture it gives you less instructions

00:04:32.380 00:04:36.100
and as you can see less writing and they

00:04:36.470 00:04:37.690
expect you to kind of picked up a lot of

00:04:37.790 00:04:39.010
the principles in the first three books

00:04:39.680 00:04:41.740
to use in this one which is fabulous if

00:04:42.230 00:04:43.420
you have done powder making because then

00:04:43.550 00:04:45.940
you just get more designs booked it's

00:04:46.460 00:04:47.920
important to note what these books don't

00:04:48.320 00:04:50.470
do if you have one of these books and

00:04:50.600 00:04:51.850
you know you have a coat mine you know

00:04:52.190 00:04:53.290
exactly what it looks like you're not

00:04:53.450 00:04:55.210
gonna find the exact same coat with the

00:04:55.490 00:04:59.380
exact same placket and pockets and call

00:04:59.570 00:05:01.840
her in one of these books you're gonna

00:05:02.030 00:05:04.180
have to use what you learn in here and

00:05:05.150 00:05:07.150
piece some things together and maybe do

00:05:07.370 00:05:08.710
two different manipulations from

00:05:09.020 00:05:11.080
different things to make that work but

00:05:11.660 00:05:13.420
for the basic block the piece that you

00:05:13.790 00:05:15.310
start with to make the jacket or the

00:05:16.060 00:05:18.969
trouser they're in here as well as all

00:05:19.100 00:05:20.469
the things like the pockets and things

00:05:20.570 00:05:21.850
that I'll help you make the design but

00:05:22.040 00:05:23.710
don't expect to find the exact design

00:05:23.990 00:05:26.020
that you had dreamed up in one of these

00:05:26.330 00:05:28.180
books I personally think this is great

00:05:28.430 00:05:31.000
because it means you have the tools to

00:05:31.250 00:05:34.490
customize any design you want

00:05:35.430 00:05:37.280
so let's get to the nitty-gritty of this

00:05:38.570 00:05:40.910
book pattern making for fashion design

00:05:41.220 00:05:43.130
by Helen Joseph Armstrong it is a

00:05:43.980 00:05:45.230
fabulous book it not only gives you

00:05:45.570 00:05:47.270
step-by-step on pattern making it starts

00:05:47.490 00:05:49.130
off at the beginning with all the tools

00:05:49.530 00:05:51.560
and steps you need to be able to start

00:05:52.110 00:05:53.720
pattern making it has lots of

00:05:54.420 00:05:56.090
descriptions for each of the designs and

00:05:56.820 00:05:58.730
pictures that are easy to follow there's

00:05:59.010 00:06:01.070
so much in this book it's really hard to

00:06:01.470 00:06:04.160
describe it all do you want to know what

00:06:04.320 00:06:08.390
an awl is where grain lines should go

00:06:08.790 00:06:11.450
what slash and spread means what spec

00:06:11.790 00:06:13.310
sheets are how to measure the body there

00:06:13.350 00:06:15.410
is so many things in this book that's

00:06:15.690 00:06:18.470
all just the first part after learning

00:06:18.690 00:06:20.660
how to measure yourself properly start

00:06:20.820 00:06:23.780
on the block section a block takes your

00:06:24.480 00:06:26.030
measurements and allows you to make a

00:06:26.490 00:06:29.240
kind of outline of for the basis for all

00:06:29.490 00:06:31.490
your patterns blocks don't have seam

00:06:32.190 00:06:33.080
allowances they don't have things like

00:06:33.690 00:06:35.270
pockets and things these are the things

00:06:35.430 00:06:37.400
that you manipulate to make all the

00:06:37.590 00:06:39.140
other styles and the first part of the

00:06:39.270 00:06:40.400
book you use a lot you make a lot of

00:06:40.590 00:06:42.500
these blocks and these are what you can

00:06:42.780 00:06:44.960
use to make other designs in the book or

00:06:45.480 00:06:46.850
if you're just using one of the patterns

00:06:46.950 00:06:48.080
you have at home and you want to add a

00:06:48.450 00:06:50.360
different sleeve or a collar you don't

00:06:50.640 00:06:52.460
need to use these blocks you could just

00:06:52.890 00:06:55.550
go to the page in which the manipulation

00:06:55.740 00:06:57.710
is and then make those changes

00:06:58.200 00:07:00.200
Helen Joseph Armstrong has three main

00:07:00.720 00:07:01.310
principles for a lot of her

00:07:02.040 00:07:03.969
manipulations d'art manipulations

00:07:04.979 00:07:06.920
contouring and added fullness you find

00:07:07.020 00:07:09.050
out more about these in the upcoming

00:07:09.630 00:07:12.020
chapters darts are very important in

00:07:12.479 00:07:13.640
pattern making you don't use them as

00:07:13.770 00:07:15.680
much knits but definitely for woven

00:07:16.260 00:07:17.560
fabrics if you want them to fit the body

00:07:18.570 00:07:20.030
as I said earlier I did a little pair of

00:07:20.370 00:07:22.400
school thing on we went really in-depth

00:07:22.620 00:07:23.870
and darts if you would like me to do

00:07:24.180 00:07:25.280
something like that for YouTube just let

00:07:25.380 00:07:27.020
me know in the comments so basically

00:07:27.690 00:07:29.659
without darts you wouldn't be able to

00:07:29.820 00:07:31.460
have anything that fits around the

00:07:31.770 00:07:33.710
curves of the body darts can be found in

00:07:33.900 00:07:35.960
lots of different places and this book

00:07:36.390 00:07:38.150
does talk and a great deal about them

00:07:38.310 00:07:40.850
and how to move the XS from one part of

00:07:40.950 00:07:43.250
the body to another this is a page in

00:07:43.349 00:07:45.650
the dirt section and as you can see this

00:07:45.870 00:07:46.650
book even has some

00:07:47.260 00:07:49.500
sizes at the end to try and push your

00:07:49.900 00:07:51.960
learning further it is important to note

00:07:52.000 00:07:53.250
that some of the designs seen the

00:07:53.920 00:07:54.900
exercises they don't show you how to

00:07:55.270 00:07:57.300
make they just ask you to work on them

00:07:57.700 00:07:59.040
yourself but there's lots of different

00:07:59.350 00:08:00.870
ones that you could use just darts alone

00:08:01.360 00:08:02.490
to take a dress that you have at home

00:08:02.710 00:08:04.830
and make it totally unique to you

00:08:05.350 00:08:06.780
darts aren't the only ways to get your

00:08:07.240 00:08:08.610
designs to fit around the contours of

00:08:08.710 00:08:10.530
your body you could do used art

00:08:11.080 00:08:12.510
equivalents which she discusses in here

00:08:12.640 00:08:13.110
as well

00:08:13.630 00:08:15.990
pleats gathers things like that as well

00:08:16.150 00:08:18.510
as style lines having a style line like

00:08:18.550 00:08:21.230
a princess line one that comes like this

00:08:22.240 00:08:24.330
down through there it's actually another

00:08:24.670 00:08:26.400
great way to make sure that the fullness

00:08:26.860 00:08:29.040
is taken out of the design and you can

00:08:29.320 00:08:31.440
see here that she actually suggests lots

00:08:31.660 00:08:34.050
of different variations and she does she

00:08:34.240 00:08:35.850
gives you step-by-step of how to use

00:08:36.070 00:08:40.529
your block to get from here to there her

00:08:40.900 00:08:43.380
second principle is added fullness and

00:08:44.169 00:08:45.330
there's quite a good section on this as

00:08:45.550 00:08:47.670
well how do you get the pencil skirt to

00:08:47.800 00:08:49.890
be a fuller skirt this is the section

00:08:50.110 00:08:55.920
for you it talks about gathering slash

00:08:56.230 00:08:57.750
and spread lots of different things in

00:08:58.030 00:08:59.610
order to make a design have more

00:09:00.360 00:09:02.100
fullness after all without fullness

00:09:02.320 00:09:05.270
you'd never be able to wear this outfit

00:09:06.280 00:09:08.610
the third principle contouring might

00:09:08.860 00:09:10.440
sound a little odd at first but it's

00:09:10.810 00:09:12.810
very important if you don't use some of

00:09:12.880 00:09:14.640
these contouring techniques you could

00:09:14.800 00:09:17.070
have gaping neck lines or gaping at the

00:09:17.560 00:09:19.890
armholes it basically talks about when

00:09:19.990 00:09:21.780
you cut certain bits of the pattern away

00:09:22.300 00:09:23.910
for example if you take a drip pattern

00:09:24.010 00:09:26.210
that fits you perfectly if you have a

00:09:27.220 00:09:28.590
round neck and you want to make a v-neck

00:09:28.870 00:09:31.080
and you just chop that off and then sew

00:09:31.210 00:09:32.580
it up you might have gaping at the

00:09:32.950 00:09:35.310
neckline so contouring is when you look

00:09:35.440 00:09:38.400
at your body and you take away from the

00:09:38.980 00:09:41.430
original pattern in certain places to

00:09:41.560 00:09:43.320
make it fit properly do you have to

00:09:43.600 00:09:45.210
remove some of the pattern between the

00:09:45.850 00:09:47.610
breasts off the side if you're doing a

00:09:48.870 00:09:50.880
sleeveless definitely lots of helpful

00:09:51.040 00:09:52.350
tips in this section it's something that

00:09:52.570 00:09:54.240
sometimes people miss out you could take

00:09:54.580 00:09:56.670
your favorite dress and turn it into a

00:09:56.980 00:09:58.800
spaghetti strap dress but without this

00:09:59.290 00:10:00.630
idea of contouring of

00:10:01.089 00:10:03.210
or taking it in your dress is gonna look

00:10:03.399 00:10:04.980
a little funny so that's how to take the

00:10:05.170 00:10:07.380
main blocks and make some major changes

00:10:07.450 00:10:09.329
to them style lines contouring and

00:10:09.550 00:10:10.860
things but what if you want to know more

plackets cups all those sorts and little

00:10:20.260 00:10:21.449
things that makes such a big difference

00:10:31.209 00:10:32.370
about the dress I made for the day and

00:10:32.500 00:10:34.350
night challenge this is a challenge put

00:10:34.600 00:10:36.090
forth by Elizabeth Farr of Elizabeth

00:10:36.550 00:10:38.460
maintenance and it was a lot of fun for

00:10:38.620 00:10:40.350
my night dress I did a dress that had

00:10:40.630 00:10:42.810
two cows on it a shorter one in the

00:10:42.970 00:10:45.120
front and a deeper lower one in the back

00:10:45.730 00:10:47.550
I'll put a photo here and if you watch

00:10:47.709 00:10:49.380
the video you'll find out more about how

00:10:49.420 00:10:52.259
I kept it on my shoulders how I learned

00:10:52.360 00:10:54.449
how to make this was way back in school

00:10:54.730 00:10:58.230
I did learn how to do cows from this

00:10:58.510 00:11:00.360
book so it's very good it shows you just

00:11:00.730 00:11:02.430
what you need to know to do different

00:11:02.649 00:11:05.250
cows a perfect example of how you can

00:11:05.470 00:11:07.620
learn a basic and then take it further

00:11:08.079 00:11:10.319
later so might have done just a normal

00:11:10.750 00:11:13.980
cow back then and now a cow on the front

00:11:14.140 00:11:15.569
and the back and I think it looked

00:11:15.930 00:11:18.090
fabulous do you find circle skirt spin

00:11:18.190 00:11:19.980
of the pain it had the helpful little

00:11:20.380 00:11:22.050
chart for that as well as really good

00:11:22.660 00:11:24.360
instructions for quarter circle half

00:11:24.910 00:11:27.030
circle or full circle skirts it also has

00:11:27.070 00:11:29.730
a good section on bias patterns there's

00:11:29.980 00:11:31.470
still lots more in this book coats

00:11:32.640 00:11:38.100
jackets hoods trousers knit where kids

00:11:38.880 00:11:41.040
wear tons and tons of great information

00:11:41.350 00:11:42.990
in this book she also talks about

00:11:43.540 00:11:45.750
copying ready-to-wear design very handy

00:11:45.820 00:11:46.889
if you have those pair of trousers that

00:11:47.260 00:11:48.990
just fit so perfectly that you want

00:11:49.209 00:11:50.939
another pair you gotta admit this is a

00:11:51.130 00:11:52.590
lot of book there's a lot of great stuff

00:11:52.750 00:11:53.100
in here

00:11:53.410 00:11:56.280
but there's still the appendix they have

00:11:56.320 00:11:58.829
a metric conversion chart a place where

00:11:58.930 00:12:02.720
you can put your measurements

00:12:03.730 00:12:06.210
spec sheets cost sheets and even half

00:12:06.610 00:12:09.840
scale and quarter scale blocks for you

00:12:09.970 00:12:12.210
to use overall I love this book

00:12:12.370 00:12:13.769
it helped me fall in love with pattern

00:12:14.220 00:12:16.440
making there's so much in it it helps

00:12:16.600 00:12:18.930
you do the blocks great instructions

00:12:19.209 00:12:21.509
with drawings step-by-step it takes you

00:12:21.550 00:12:23.730
right from measuring to the very end

00:12:24.040 00:12:26.340
where you can make the garment you're

00:12:26.589 00:12:28.410
ready by the time you finish this so

00:12:28.570 00:12:32.400
with a few tools and this book you can

00:12:32.649 00:12:34.110
make almost any design that you can

00:12:34.300 00:12:37.710
think of but my piece of advice if

00:12:37.899 00:12:39.840
you're gonna try it is do make sure you

00:12:40.000 00:12:41.990
make at wall practice practice practice

00:12:43.000 00:12:44.519
use a fabric that's similar to the final

00:12:44.829 00:12:45.810
fabric you're gonna use in your design

00:12:46.570 00:12:49.170
because it would be so sad for you to

00:12:49.480 00:12:51.389
try something new and then get

00:12:52.000 00:12:52.920
frustrated when it didn't work the first

00:12:53.019 00:12:55.139
time twirling or making a muslin a

00:12:55.600 00:12:57.210
practice copy is a very important part

00:12:57.370 00:12:59.639
of pattern making just as a heads up I

00:12:59.889 00:13:01.470
