00:00:00.870 00:00:02.780
hello everyone this week I'm going back

00:00:03.030 00:00:05.030
to the roots of my channel with a

00:00:05.609 00:00:07.280
personal development book breaking the

00:00:07.589 00:00:09.259
habit of being yourself by dr. Joe

00:00:09.740 00:00:12.650
Dispenza released on February 15 2012

00:00:13.080 00:00:16.060
and the book has 303 pages not including

00:00:17.070 00:00:19.420
appendices and the endnotes and all that

00:00:20.430 00:00:21.679
as I said it's a personal development

00:00:22.140 00:00:25.130
book and to quickly give it a

00:00:25.380 00:00:27.410
run-through and then I'll explain why I

00:00:27.660 00:00:28.730
kind of read this because I haven't read

00:00:28.800 00:00:30.169
a personal development book in a long

00:00:30.390 00:00:34.580
time so this book the goal of this book

00:00:34.860 00:00:37.520
is to not talk about the external things

00:00:38.190 00:00:41.060
in your life not how to change anything

00:00:42.350 00:00:45.770
outside but really to focus on the

00:00:46.170 00:00:48.670
inside and when I started this channel

00:00:49.680 00:00:54.770
that was a big focus of mine but it's

00:00:54.960 00:00:56.660
how this book is broken down as dr. Joe

00:00:57.050 00:00:59.180
Dispenza first he explains how your mind

00:00:59.579 00:01:01.880
operates on a scientific level he

00:01:02.340 00:01:06.969
explains how cells brain cells create

00:01:07.979 00:01:08.870
connections with each other he

00:01:09.450 00:01:13.520
constantly uses this saying that I think

00:01:13.650 00:01:15.200
it's like sells out that fire together

00:01:15.450 00:01:18.070
wire together something like that and

00:01:19.080 00:01:22.300
the point is that he's a firm believer

00:01:23.310 00:01:26.359
that you can change and alter things

00:01:26.640 00:01:29.480
about your personality and your body and

00:01:29.670 00:01:31.219
and the world around you

00:01:31.350 00:01:35.090
by changing the essentially how you

00:01:35.549 00:01:37.219
think and not how you think changes the

00:01:37.979 00:01:41.030
Physiol physiology of your brain so he

00:01:41.520 00:01:42.830
explains scientifically how that works

00:01:43.110 00:01:44.719
how the brain cells work and receive

00:01:45.390 00:01:46.910
information and and create like

00:01:47.430 00:01:49.160
personality traits that's kind of part

00:01:49.320 00:01:51.760
one of the book then part 2 of the book

00:01:52.770 00:01:56.600
explains how meditation into how your

00:01:56.880 00:01:58.459
brain works while meditating and how

00:01:59.040 00:02:01.789
your brain interacts while meditating

00:02:02.100 00:02:04.280
and how the shifts occur which is

00:02:04.560 00:02:06.920
something I never really looked into too

00:02:07.170 00:02:09.290
much I just took meditation as a good

00:02:09.479 00:02:11.750
thing I face value and I never thought

00:02:11.819 00:02:13.010
about the science behind it because I

00:02:13.170 00:02:14.040
thought oh it's spirit

00:02:14.290 00:02:15.450
they'd have made like there's no science

00:02:15.700 00:02:17.520
it's a spiritual thing but he kind of

00:02:17.950 00:02:19.310
says you know why the key he's a

00:02:20.320 00:02:22.260
neuroscientist and he's done many

00:02:22.660 00:02:24.150
experiments on people meditating and

00:02:24.310 00:02:27.030
things like that brain imaging etc and

00:02:27.670 00:02:29.250
kind of shows like this is how your

00:02:29.530 00:02:32.010
brain works when you're in different

00:02:32.650 00:02:33.720
states and he goes through these

00:02:33.970 00:02:36.000
different like alpha states or alpha

00:02:36.220 00:02:38.970
waves theta waves beta waves and I'm

00:02:39.220 00:02:40.500
trying I'm making it sound like a lot

00:02:40.660 00:02:43.050
more complicated than it is and but he

00:02:43.510 00:02:45.200
explains it like he dumbs it down nicely

00:02:46.210 00:02:48.480
in the sense of like when you're born

00:02:48.910 00:02:50.490
this is what your brain typically is in

00:02:50.920 00:02:52.230
and then when you get older your brains

00:02:52.630 00:02:57.410
in this kind of waves and then as we get

00:02:58.420 00:03:00.420
in our adult life I believe we're in

00:03:00.580 00:03:03.630
this constant like stress beta wave like

00:03:03.880 00:03:06.480
our minds are kind of too high frequency

00:03:06.790 00:03:08.730
where we're worrying about everything

00:03:09.040 00:03:10.260
and we're thinking how can we change all

00:03:10.360 00:03:12.870
these problems and that's in his

00:03:13.480 00:03:15.360
explanation how we get sick how we get

00:03:15.760 00:03:19.229
diseases most diseases how these kind of

00:03:19.690 00:03:20.820
negative things keep happening in our

00:03:21.100 00:03:22.440
lives because then we program our

00:03:23.440 00:03:26.400
personality to kind of like recreate

00:03:26.770 00:03:29.400
this cycle this loop because in our

00:03:29.950 00:03:31.650
minds that's what we want even though we

00:03:31.870 00:03:33.180
don't consciously want it subconsciously

00:03:33.940 00:03:36.150
we're gaining something from it anyway

00:03:36.310 00:03:39.020
I'm rambling on then part 3 is then

00:03:40.030 00:03:41.610
which is great with the point of this

00:03:41.830 00:03:45.510
book is part 3 is how to meditate

00:03:45.940 00:03:48.300
he gives step by step by step and he

00:03:48.550 00:03:50.400
says start week 1 just do this step

00:03:51.070 00:03:52.800
start and then we to do these steps and

00:03:53.380 00:03:54.900
kind of compound and until you get the

00:03:55.060 00:03:57.900
whole process over a four-week period is

00:03:58.060 00:04:00.630
his recommendation but he said even if

00:04:00.760 00:04:03.960
you take longer it's fine but like kind

00:04:04.090 00:04:06.000
of try to master learn each step as

00:04:06.190 00:04:07.320
you're going instead of trying to do the

00:04:07.480 00:04:09.930
whole thing at once and he gives this he

00:04:10.330 00:04:12.540
provides this whole meditation process

00:04:13.180 00:04:17.460
that he uses to rewire your brain so the

00:04:17.650 00:04:18.599
book is called breaking the habit of

00:04:18.760 00:04:20.520
being yourself and I gotta say when I

00:04:20.769 00:04:22.770
first this book was first recommended to

00:04:22.900 00:04:25.290
me I didn't want to read it because I

00:04:25.810 00:04:27.870
thought at face value

00:04:27.910 00:04:29.940
I thought all that means I gotta try to

00:04:30.220 00:04:32.610
be someone I'm not to be successful

00:04:33.280 00:04:34.590
that's what my interpretation of the

00:04:34.750 00:04:38.160
book was but then by chance somebody

00:04:38.560 00:04:40.950
else refer to YouTube video to me of

00:04:41.620 00:04:44.250
this gentleman funny how the world works

00:04:44.530 00:04:48.480
of dr. Dispenza talking about what he

00:04:48.670 00:04:50.010
talks about in the book and I had no

00:04:50.140 00:04:51.420
idea that he was the author of this book

00:04:51.940 00:04:54.180
I just okay let me watch this video and

00:04:54.670 00:04:56.990
the way he explained it makes more sense

00:04:58.000 00:04:59.220
it's not about trying to be someone

00:04:59.590 00:05:01.080
you're not or someone you don't want to

00:05:01.240 00:05:03.870
be it's about about changing the

00:05:04.420 00:05:05.970
elements of yourself that are not

00:05:06.220 00:05:07.920
working for you are things about

00:05:08.670 00:05:11.960
yourself that are that you don't like

00:05:13.230 00:05:15.530
because they're not true to who you are

00:05:16.540 00:05:18.900
so inherently we might be an angry

00:05:19.230 00:05:21.990
person right and I might not like that

00:05:22.300 00:05:24.420
about myself let's say there's an

00:05:26.890 00:05:29.130
that's what right now myself would be

00:05:29.290 00:05:30.810
angry in that mindset so breaking the

00:05:31.120 00:05:32.780
habit of being myself would be trying to

00:05:33.790 00:05:36.870
unwire this anger or this natural anger

00:05:37.090 00:05:39.570
and rewire something new like a state of

00:05:39.880 00:05:43.320
happiness or gratitude or abundance or

00:05:43.630 00:05:45.720
whatever and that's what he's really his

00:05:45.970 00:05:47.790
real goal is so I misinterpreted the

00:05:48.220 00:05:49.760
title and I hope other people don't

00:05:50.770 00:05:51.810
misinterpret it I hope other people

00:05:52.180 00:05:56.190
don't misinterpret it and yeah so I plan

00:05:56.730 00:06:00.360
to try to incorporate this meditation

00:06:01.060 00:06:03.090
process I need to reread the last part

00:06:03.280 00:06:05.880
and it's in chapters in bisection so I

00:06:06.130 00:06:08.040
need to really like dig in and take

00:06:08.320 00:06:11.100
notes and like get that understanding

00:06:11.740 00:06:13.500
and there's also guided meditations I

00:06:13.660 00:06:17.820
need to find to start this but I really

00:06:17.980 00:06:21.990
want to get into this because I'm at

00:06:22.210 00:06:23.520
this point this video will be released

00:06:23.830 00:06:26.100
up I have just started school I am 31

00:06:26.260 00:06:28.140
years old and I'm going to do my

00:06:29.040 00:06:30.540
undergrad something I've been putting

00:06:30.640 00:06:32.640
off for a long time I'm not going to get

00:06:32.830 00:06:36.150
into all the personal elements but I'm

00:06:36.640 00:06:37.650
looking forward to that and I'm not

00:06:38.169 00:06:38.640
worried about that

00:06:39.450 00:06:41.540
but for a while like

00:06:41.640 00:06:43.340
when I first started this channel a lot

00:06:43.440 00:06:45.920
of things were going well for me and I

00:06:46.560 00:06:48.260
was felt like I was in that state like

00:06:48.510 00:06:50.000
kind of in these states of abundance and

00:06:50.250 00:06:52.370
and wealth and growth and then in the

00:06:52.590 00:06:57.640
last year or so i i've had a shift and i

00:06:58.650 00:07:01.160
want to get back to that kind of state

00:07:01.200 00:07:04.970
of abundance so I guess that's why again

00:07:05.250 00:07:07.430
I believe in the universe and the you

00:07:07.530 00:07:10.280
know energy and I guess that's why this

00:07:10.620 00:07:13.880
book kept kind of showing up to me and I

00:07:14.070 00:07:16.310
guess why is subtly I had to discover it

00:07:16.470 00:07:18.260
in a roundabout way by watching a

00:07:18.570 00:07:20.300
youtube video up front by the author

00:07:21.060 00:07:22.370
that I had no idea was the author of

00:07:22.590 00:07:25.010
this book so I put that as a sign

00:07:26.010 00:07:27.350
whatever you want to call it and I was

00:07:27.420 00:07:28.310
like okay I really want to read this

00:07:28.620 00:07:30.860
book and I read it and I felt already I

00:07:31.170 00:07:33.590
felt empowered like I haven't done the

00:07:34.080 00:07:35.480
meditation yep I have felt empowered and

00:07:36.390 00:07:39.110
renewed with the feeling of which I've

00:07:39.450 00:07:40.850
already talked about many times in old

00:07:41.330 00:07:46.100
videos the power that I can create the

00:07:46.140 00:07:49.460
life that I desire what's different

00:07:49.500 00:07:51.560
between myself now and two years ago

00:07:52.050 00:07:54.920
almost two years ago yeah I almost was

00:07:55.320 00:07:56.330
almost two years I've been doing this

00:07:57.140 00:08:00.800
channel yeah anyway and the difference

00:08:00.870 00:08:02.900
between myself now and back then is I

00:08:03.510 00:08:07.220
have it more real not realistic more

00:08:07.530 00:08:12.350
real to myself vision of what I desire I

00:08:13.140 00:08:15.260
still want great nice fancy things and a

00:08:15.690 00:08:18.050
successful life but I my desires are

00:08:19.340 00:08:21.410
more real as the only word I can think

00:08:21.600 00:08:23.870
of true to myself and that's why I'm

00:08:24.030 00:08:25.370
really excited because now I feel like I

00:08:25.560 00:08:26.960
can really manifest what I want because

00:08:27.840 00:08:30.200
there's more of a coherence between what

00:08:30.330 00:08:32.000
I'm thinking what I'm feeling and what I

00:08:32.370 00:08:35.270
want and that's all I have to say I made

00:08:35.310 00:08:37.550
a little bit of a personal you know I

00:08:38.220 00:08:39.830
got personal after the review but check

00:08:39.990 00:08:41.210
this book out if you're if you're

00:08:41.700 00:08:42.740
feeling like you're kind of stuck in

00:08:43.080 00:08:46.580
life if you're feeling nothing's

00:08:47.010 00:08:47.840
changing for you everything is

00:08:48.330 00:08:49.610
constantly the same this takes a

00:08:49.800 00:08:51.940
different more practical approach

00:08:52.950 00:08:54.560
there's less of those like little

00:08:55.860 00:08:58.580
about this person to do their sum but

00:08:58.950 00:09:00.310
there's still but there's a lot more

00:09:01.320 00:09:04.040
practical science knowledge just have an

00:09:04.320 00:09:06.830
open mind that there is a he even

00:09:07.230 00:09:08.360
explains how there's an energy between

00:09:08.940 00:09:11.720
the the sub particles in cells the the

00:09:12.540 00:09:14.090
quantum realm he calls it the subatomic

00:09:14.850 00:09:16.160
particles I'm getting a little too

00:09:16.770 00:09:18.140
science e right now but like he explains

00:09:18.650 00:09:21.230
how there's an infinite possibilities of

00:09:21.839 00:09:23.780
reality between what we can observe and

00:09:24.420 00:09:26.840
or sorry what we are observing and what

00:09:27.270 00:09:30.440
could happen etc I'm rambling now yeah

00:09:30.810 00:09:32.540
so I guess that's why I got stuck really
