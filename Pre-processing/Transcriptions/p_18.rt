00:00:00.480 00:00:02.780
hey people obviously I've got a new look

00:00:02.939 00:00:04.280
going on hope you'd like it

00:00:04.650 00:00:06.860
it's the vault look I don't think I look

00:00:06.990 00:00:08.770
too bad was it

00:00:09.780 00:00:10.879
the surgery went okay I just want to

00:00:10.980 00:00:12.020
address some questions people have had

00:00:12.349 00:00:14.060
and it'll be easier for me to make a

00:00:14.219 00:00:15.950
video about it than to just respond to

00:00:16.260 00:00:17.599
everybody individually

00:00:17.869 00:00:20.870
I was actually posed to get the surgery

00:00:21.060 00:00:24.679
done a couple weeks ago but they got me

00:00:24.750 00:00:25.970
all strapped up to the machine and got

00:00:26.070 00:00:28.310
me in there and then one of the machines

00:00:28.650 00:00:29.810
wasn't I wasn't working correctly that

00:00:30.029 00:00:33.799
maps the brain so we cancelled which is

00:00:34.050 00:00:34.700
probably a good thing the head nurse

00:00:35.010 00:00:35.900
wasn't there the head and Rolla just

00:00:36.120 00:00:37.520
wasn't there this wasn't the right time

00:00:37.920 00:00:39.889
so we cancelled that I had done this

00:00:40.170 00:00:44.540
past Tuesday which is October 8th

00:00:45.360 00:00:49.430
October 8th of this year so first off

00:00:49.649 00:00:53.240
here's my scarring that's on the top to

00:00:53.340 00:00:55.819
the right side done I can't see the back

00:00:55.980 00:00:57.580
of my head maybe you can see it

00:00:59.239 00:01:00.799
obviously they're starting back there

00:01:01.050 00:01:04.460
and then I have on my chest this is

00:01:04.710 00:01:15.660
where the battery was inserted our show

00:01:16.570 00:01:18.230
anyways it's in the it's in my chester

00:01:20.400 00:01:23.990
battery cool things I'm doing okay

00:01:25.000 00:01:27.180
the worst thing about the whole thing

00:01:27.990 00:01:30.330
was being off my medication absolutely

00:01:30.460 00:01:36.630
the worst thing just because I I was in

00:01:36.759 00:01:40.560
so much pain from cramping in and the

00:01:40.900 00:01:42.420
dystonia not being able to sleep the

00:01:42.550 00:01:45.090
night before it was that was the worst

00:01:45.159 00:01:50.070
thing by far surgery lasted I think

00:01:50.350 00:01:51.690
three hours right maybe a little longer

00:01:51.970 00:01:52.830
I don't know what it knocked me out

00:01:53.020 00:01:57.690
pretty quick if you're going into this

00:01:58.450 00:02:00.719
it's it's it is a little scary but I

00:02:00.940 00:02:07.410
mean it's it's a safe procedure the most

00:02:07.690 00:02:08.550
painful thing about it like I said was

00:02:08.709 00:02:11.340
being up the medication it is a little

00:02:11.440 00:02:12.900
scary to hear your skull getting cut

00:02:13.150 00:02:14.340
into it sounds like you're in a

00:02:14.739 00:02:17.040
construction site and even my mouth was

00:02:17.140 00:02:19.440
like your teeth are chattering like you

00:02:19.570 00:02:24.780
know like I was cold but right now I'm

00:02:24.940 00:02:26.190
trying to get more rest and recover as

00:02:27.100 00:02:28.170
it's only been like three days since of

00:02:30.630 00:02:33.000
so some more questions sorry I got to

00:02:33.130 00:02:39.949
look over here and see you with me

00:02:39.989 00:02:42.830
I only said one day in the hospital one

00:02:42.989 00:02:44.869
day I was soon really nauseous nauseous

00:02:45.239 00:02:47.030
the next day and I threw up they kept me

00:02:47.310 00:02:47.960
longer and they were gonna keep me

00:02:48.060 00:02:49.699
overnight again I didn't want to go home

00:02:50.330 00:02:52.009
I mean they didn't they didn't want me

00:02:52.140 00:02:52.640
to go home

00:02:53.159 00:02:54.080
they weren't keep me another day usually

00:02:54.299 00:02:55.580
the only keeping one day they ended up

00:02:55.709 00:02:56.660
letting me go because I felt that her

00:02:57.360 00:02:58.309
but I still had been having some nausea

00:02:58.890 00:03:01.910
I did eat some pizza and some stuff with

00:03:02.099 00:03:05.059
sugar that was not good so stay away

00:03:05.159 00:03:07.160
from that definitely been eating better

00:03:07.440 00:03:08.960
just soup and oatmeal and stuff like

00:03:11.690 00:03:13.699
that the most painful thing now is this

00:03:14.780 00:03:17.569
the staples staples have bought the crap

00:03:17.760 00:03:21.680
out of me but other than that doing okay

00:03:22.170 00:03:24.259
doing doing good

00:03:24.299 00:03:28.160
I had immediate relief when they found

00:03:28.319 00:03:30.050
it at right area they were trying to

00:03:30.480 00:03:32.149
search for that area and my brain the

00:03:32.579 00:03:33.470
neurologist is moving my arm up and down

00:03:33.720 00:03:35.750
up and down up and down to see if how

00:03:36.120 00:03:38.030
how much it lessened the dystonia and

00:03:38.159 00:03:40.339
the rigidity in my arm and when I got

00:03:40.470 00:03:41.240
out of there I could just move it

00:03:41.940 00:03:43.220
completely well because I'm hardly on

00:03:43.409 00:03:45.319
any medication right now and this is

00:03:45.709 00:03:47.740
because the inflammation in your brain

00:03:48.750 00:03:52.580
kind of causes kind of causes that to

00:03:52.859 00:03:54.740
happen they said I'll get the effects of

00:03:54.810 00:03:56.750
this for a few days so this has been

00:03:56.910 00:03:58.400
three or four days now I'm just like

00:03:58.590 00:03:59.740
will they move my hands pretty well I

00:04:00.750 00:04:02.089
had no cramping at all they gave me some

00:04:02.910 00:04:05.210
clothes on I don't know some medication

00:04:05.250 00:04:07.460
to help with cramping I'm a biking I had

00:04:07.560 00:04:09.439
this medication before now it really

00:04:09.690 00:04:14.050
helps me for cramping in my feet but

00:04:15.060 00:04:17.990
yeah there's just it's a was a

00:04:18.840 00:04:19.370
experience that I'm gonna have to do

00:04:19.500 00:04:24.110
again here in two months not looking

00:04:24.330 00:04:25.550
forward to it but I kind of am at the

00:04:25.680 00:04:28.909
same time I'll have the DBS generator

00:04:29.340 00:04:30.560
that's in my chest turned on at the end

00:04:30.660 00:04:34.550
of this month and I can see you know how

00:04:35.039 00:04:37.010
well it affects me

00:04:37.919 00:04:40.270
they said this the defects of the the

00:04:41.389 00:04:43.909
swelling will wear off if for a few days

00:04:44.370 00:04:45.790
so I will have to increase in medication

00:04:46.800 00:04:48.469
eventually at some point this is not

00:04:48.570 00:04:49.580
going to be happening and I'll be able

00:04:49.740 00:04:52.960
to my hands or my arms anymore

00:04:53.330 00:04:55.240
like I was able to but it's crazy that I

00:04:56.240 00:04:57.550
that I'm able to move my left side

00:04:58.070 00:04:59.470
better than my right side that's just I

00:05:00.050 00:05:01.480
haven't had that happen and I don't

00:05:01.640 00:05:03.130
remember I ever remember that happening

00:05:04.040 00:05:05.350
I've never had my left side worked

00:05:05.480 00:05:06.580
better than my right side so it's kind

00:05:06.620 00:05:08.130
of weird like even walking I'm just like

00:05:09.140 00:05:10.420
like I'm like a penguin like trying to

00:05:10.610 00:05:12.220
like figure out how to walk you know I'm

00:05:12.710 00:05:16.180
bobbling around do you guys like my

00:05:16.400 00:05:18.700
shaped head just I don't think it looked

00:05:18.740 00:05:19.000
that bad

00:05:20.000 00:05:22.150
kinda I bet something that's definitely

00:05:22.400 00:05:23.920
my head like I could I just never could

00:05:24.050 00:05:26.380
take a shower had to wait four days take

00:05:26.420 00:05:29.710
a shower geez that was like one step

00:05:29.960 00:05:35.170
still on here they put on there other

00:05:35.210 00:05:36.670
than that enter question somebody had

00:05:36.860 00:05:42.670
for me oh yeah

00:05:42.710 00:05:45.010
I thought like I talked to other

00:05:45.230 00:05:46.360
people's DBS and they were like oh yeah

00:05:46.400 00:05:47.590
I was that the next day I was doing all

00:05:47.720 00:05:50.440
this kinda stuff for me no I was I was

00:05:50.540 00:05:51.640
out the next day but they were I was not

00:05:51.800 00:05:52.810
able to do crap they didn't want me

00:05:53.180 00:05:55.000
lifting anything they wanted me in bed

00:05:55.220 00:05:57.010
like I was sleeping all the time I'm

00:05:57.110 00:05:58.630
just now feeling better like after three

00:05:58.670 00:06:01.810
or four days and so I don't know maybe

00:06:01.970 00:06:03.280
it's doing for other people but I was

00:06:03.440 00:06:04.810
laid up I was knocked out I felt weak

00:06:05.240 00:06:08.110
after that surgery very weak and I

00:06:08.810 00:06:10.330
definitely was glad that I had somebody

00:06:10.640 00:06:11.920
there to help me I'm definitely thankful

00:06:12.230 00:06:15.130
for my wife to be there and she was

00:06:15.260 00:06:16.570
there to help me and she's been helping

00:06:16.700 00:06:19.480
me here at home and I'm really not gonna

00:06:19.730 00:06:21.640
leave for a few more days I don't have

00:06:22.210 00:06:23.980
to definitely not wanna get sick or been

00:06:24.530 00:06:28.000
infection so yeah it wasn't quite as

00:06:28.220 00:06:29.290
like I don't know they make it sound

00:06:29.420 00:06:30.580
like it's really easy and simple but

00:06:30.740 00:06:31.930
it's really it's not it's still brain

00:06:32.300 00:06:33.700
surgery you're still gonna need time to

00:06:34.750 00:06:36.670
recover you're certainly dressed and

00:06:36.740 00:06:37.660
you're sure gonna need someone to help

00:06:38.020 00:06:40.210
you help you get dressed and everything

00:06:41.230 00:06:43.330
because I can't pick up my daughter

00:06:43.520 00:06:44.680
right now because the staples in my

00:06:45.160 00:06:48.310
chest yeah so basically when Fran says

00:06:48.590 00:06:49.630
it wasn't in a cakewalk

00:06:50.330 00:06:51.820
but it wasn't it wasn't you bet so I

00:06:52.160 00:06:53.910
will do it again here in a few months

00:06:55.060 00:06:58.090
and I'm sure the progress of this this

00:06:58.480 00:07:00.550
thing hopefully my hair grows over that

00:07:00.950 00:07:02.940
because that's pretty gruesome

00:07:03.580 00:07:06.030
but if you have any messages sync spying

00:07:06.160 00:07:10.410
on Twitter I'll be on there and I'll

00:07:10.630 00:07:13.770
send an update here soon

00:07:13.960 00:07:18.390
I'm soonish alright thanks guys
