00:00:11.759 00:00:21.589
Jazmin stir okay my diagnosis um mitosis

00:00:21.990 00:00:24.650
was more complicated than I think a lot

00:00:24.750 00:00:26.089
of people's although less complicated

00:00:26.219 00:00:29.389
than some um I was fourteen when I had

00:00:30.259 00:00:33.170
symptoms I first felt it as a pain in my

00:00:33.570 00:00:36.610
leg in my foot my ankle on my left leg

00:00:37.620 00:00:39.110
and I remember it I was saying in

00:00:39.360 00:00:40.340
English class and this happened in my

00:00:40.649 00:00:44.540
freshman English class and I was trying

00:00:44.610 00:00:45.890
to figure out you know H it just felt

00:00:46.110 00:00:47.180
different than anything I've ever felt

00:00:47.430 00:00:52.160
in my life before and it didn't go away

00:00:52.260 00:00:54.580
it got worse and it I started having

00:00:55.590 00:00:56.510
different sensitivities in my leg

00:00:56.970 00:00:58.819
different pain in my left leg I started

00:00:58.920 00:01:02.360
having difficulty walking and eventually

00:01:02.460 00:01:03.440
it wasn't a month to chew it had

00:01:03.780 00:01:05.030
progressed to where I was in both legs

00:01:05.339 00:01:06.889
and I was having a really hard time

00:01:07.229 00:01:09.200
walking and moving it was very slow very

00:01:10.610 00:01:12.170
rigid and I had been a pretty active

00:01:12.840 00:01:14.480
person before that so it was pretty

00:01:15.560 00:01:17.510
unusual you know it's just a neurologist

00:01:17.909 00:01:20.210
and we couldn't figure it out and by the

00:01:20.460 00:01:23.899
time I was finally diagnosed 18 my first

00:01:24.360 00:01:25.670
diagnosis was Debra responsive dystonia

00:01:25.950 00:01:28.190
which um okay a little more into that in

00:01:28.320 00:01:31.580
a sec but my symptoms when I was at 18

00:01:32.220 00:01:33.469
it was pretty much full body

00:01:33.510 00:01:36.190
I had rigidity and almost every joint

00:01:37.200 00:01:39.679
brady kinesia was a huge issue it's just

00:01:39.810 00:01:41.300
so well like 80 year olds would walk

00:01:41.340 00:01:44.109
past me in the house of grocery stores

00:01:45.119 00:01:46.460
that's pretty sad

00:01:46.799 00:01:48.380
and I was just I never had a very bad

00:01:48.780 00:01:50.230
tremor I was always more of the rigid

00:01:51.240 00:01:52.999
the very rigid slow it was almost the

00:01:53.220 00:01:54.740
lack of motion as opposed to too much

00:01:55.130 00:01:58.730
motion was more of my issue um I would

00:01:58.890 00:02:00.859
get the worst day so I had idea spasms

00:02:00.930 00:02:03.320
in my eyes I was like the spinny and the

00:02:03.630 00:02:06.530
muscles controlling my eyes which are

00:02:06.630 00:02:09.080
the most problematic because it looks

00:02:09.239 00:02:10.309
like you're having a seizure but your

00:02:10.739 00:02:11.929
conscious you're like I'm fine

00:02:12.480 00:02:14.030
like I just look like I'm having

00:02:17.910 00:02:21.080
it's super fun to explain to people but

00:02:21.720 00:02:24.229
I was so I was at first and you know my

00:02:24.540 00:02:25.580
neurologist I found this really great

00:02:26.300 00:02:28.550
neurologist who was the first person to

00:02:28.739 00:02:31.339
say I don't know what you have I know

00:02:31.500 00:02:32.870
you have something and we're not going

00:02:32.910 00:02:34.460
to give up on you

00:02:34.739 00:02:36.949
and so I went back to him right after I

00:02:37.170 00:02:38.120
would say everything happens to me in

00:02:38.900 00:02:42.589
October it was October of 2012 I had

00:02:42.750 00:02:48.410
just turned 18 and I my ankle had

00:02:48.630 00:02:50.000
twisted and really badly it was pronated

00:02:50.280 00:02:53.360
about 80 degrees and that made my doctor

00:02:53.670 00:02:55.069
the how much worth the pronation i've

00:02:55.380 00:02:56.839
gotten made my doctor think to try

00:02:57.299 00:02:59.390
Sinemet and so he gave me some minute

00:02:59.579 00:03:01.580
and within a couple weeks I could move

00:03:01.799 00:03:04.900
again in ways that I hadn't in years I

00:03:06.019 00:03:08.930
was it was my first year at that

00:03:09.390 00:03:12.830
University and I had been there about a

00:03:12.989 00:03:15.680
month and I went into school and with

00:03:15.780 00:03:17.030
the prescription I came back two weeks

00:03:17.250 00:03:19.640
later to visit my parents you know my

00:03:19.829 00:03:20.870
dad that's really how you're feeling I

00:03:21.030 00:03:21.920
said you know I was a little bit in

00:03:21.989 00:03:23.809
denial like I don't want to you know I

00:03:23.940 00:03:25.370
don't want to believe this but like look

00:03:25.650 00:03:27.559
and so I laid down on a bed and I could

00:03:27.720 00:03:30.680
lift my leg up like pretty easily was

00:03:31.049 00:03:32.210
before if I had tried to lift my leg up

00:03:32.430 00:03:33.620
more than two inches it would just shake

00:03:33.900 00:03:36.349
and just it would get so stiff I could

00:03:36.450 00:03:37.910
it was it was a huge struggle to lift it

00:03:37.950 00:03:39.140
to Andrews off a bed in here I could

00:03:39.269 00:03:40.280
just like let my like two feet in the

00:03:41.480 00:03:43.789
air and so's diagnosed at a responsive

00:03:44.130 00:03:46.250
dystonia which is a master Parkinson's

00:03:46.590 00:03:49.009
it's a typically affects children it's a

00:03:49.319 00:03:51.860
metabolic error in dopamine and people

00:03:52.019 00:03:54.140
looked up responsive dystonia are stable

00:03:54.239 00:03:57.170
on their medication for a long time they

00:03:57.209 00:03:58.819
can take Parkinson's medication for

00:03:59.609 00:04:01.699
20-30 years and still be doing well on

00:04:01.970 00:04:07.250
it so yeah except I progressed on

00:04:08.220 00:04:10.490
Sinemet I be kept needing more and more

00:04:10.650 00:04:12.800
it's very low in denial like oh maybe I

00:04:13.019 00:04:14.839
just have a really nasty case of this we

00:04:15.090 00:04:17.719
took it off my dose yet and then I got

00:04:17.849 00:04:19.610
the point where I was taking by the time

00:04:19.680 00:04:20.750
I turned 20

00:04:21.450 00:04:23.240
same month it was it was like the last

00:04:23.640 00:04:26.360
week of October that I got dyskinesia

00:04:27.000 00:04:29.000
two years later at that point I was

00:04:29.280 00:04:31.730
taking six

00:04:31.950 00:04:36.460
and one as elect and I got dyskinesia

00:04:37.470 00:04:39.290
and that was sort of the start of a big

00:04:39.720 00:04:41.090
downhill slope but that was the point

00:04:41.340 00:04:42.920
when I got the dyskinesia with the point

00:04:43.050 00:04:44.270
when they said you definitely just have

00:04:44.870 00:04:54.760
Parkinson's so yeah I didn't expect it

00:04:55.770 00:04:58.640
yeah we didn't expect it I'm definitely

00:04:58.740 00:05:01.580
not the only one there's a couple of us

00:05:01.890 00:05:04.190
I I want to say I know people I know

00:05:04.380 00:05:06.890
maybe 10 15 people now who have had it

00:05:06.990 00:05:17.360
in their teens yeah I think it's a

00:05:17.610 00:05:19.910
little bit of both it's definitely a

00:05:20.130 00:05:21.050
little bit both I think it's being

00:05:21.450 00:05:23.230
diagnosed a lot faster which is good

00:05:24.240 00:05:26.120
because you know I think that my four

00:05:26.340 00:05:27.980
years was way too long to get diagnosed

00:05:28.590 00:05:30.950
a lot of my friends fear about my age or

00:05:31.320 00:05:33.890
in the eighth year 7 to 8 year to get

00:05:34.290 00:05:36.950
diagnosed range which was just a min

00:05:37.950 00:05:46.130
Sarah was it's a long time not knowing I

00:05:46.290 00:05:47.210
mean four years not knowing was

00:05:47.550 00:05:49.510
maddening especially because the doctors

00:05:50.520 00:05:52.700
a lot of neurologists kind of have a god

00:05:52.950 00:05:55.700
complex and there yeah and so as soon as

00:05:55.920 00:05:58.660
they run out of the answers is it's your

00:05:59.670 00:06:01.910
head and it's psychosomatic which is

00:06:02.340 00:06:06.500
really unhelpful yeah it's like thanks

00:06:06.630 00:06:34.630
and pretty sure it's not but you know

00:06:35.640 00:06:38.810
it's kind of yeah my dad is in his 50s I

00:06:39.000 00:06:40.310
was with him and I was thinking like

00:06:40.830 00:06:43.010
everyone's gonna think he's the

00:06:44.020 00:06:55.409
it was that gray hair and everything you

00:06:55.630 00:06:56.749
have is kind of the traditional

00:06:57.759 00:06:59.719
Parkinson's there is no traditional

00:07:00.729 00:07:01.830
that's true there's no traditional

00:07:02.500 00:07:09.390
medications when it refused it may be

00:07:09.639 00:07:11.730
said like 2030 people with Parkinson's

00:07:12.099 00:07:13.320
and the people that I'm yet to interview

00:07:13.690 00:07:26.070
she's dead them all in a way I call it a

00:07:26.470 00:07:31.439
snowflake disc is right yeah Yeah right

00:07:32.289 00:07:32.909
so pretty

00:07:33.729 00:07:35.999
nope yeah no it's that's just really

00:07:36.400 00:07:38.610
interesting you know one time I sat down

00:07:38.889 00:07:40.620
my I listed all of the symptoms that I

00:07:40.840 00:07:43.230
could think of that's a pretty exhausted

00:07:43.509 00:07:45.120
list I think there were 27 different

00:07:45.520 00:07:46.980
symptoms like that I could think of and

00:07:47.050 00:07:50.969
I'm sure I missed something and if you

00:07:51.130 00:07:53.189
think about the fact that every one of

00:07:53.380 00:07:56.459
us has some combination of these 27 with

00:07:56.860 00:07:59.969
some in higher you know you know like I

00:08:03.719 00:08:08.159
had yours and even now my tremor is

00:08:09.130 00:08:10.770
numbers it's my hands are still thanks

00:08:10.840 00:08:14.010
to des but even my tremors probably

00:08:14.229 00:08:18.600
maybe like that much of a wobble my

00:08:18.849 00:08:33.120
tremor is pretty pretty mild kind of

00:08:33.789 00:08:35.100
patient perhaps just me because they can

00:08:35.289 00:08:45.810
see that I'm struggling I think I wore

00:08:45.940 00:08:47.430
an ankle brace on my leg good for a

00:08:47.620 00:08:48.990
while before I had the DBS because I

00:08:49.149 00:08:50.610
just couldn't walk I couldn't walk flat

00:08:50.740 00:08:51.360
on my side

00:08:51.760 00:08:53.069
it's the ankle brace kept me safe

00:08:53.650 00:08:55.079
walking it kept me from tripping over my

00:08:56.529 00:08:58.410
and I was everyone first god that was a

00:08:58.510 00:08:59.699
little bit conscious the fact that all

00:08:59.740 00:09:00.930
of a sudden I felt like everyone could

00:09:01.000 00:09:02.400
see the disability and then I was like

00:09:02.890 00:09:07.860
this is so nice oh now people aren't

00:09:08.170 00:09:10.050
just like wondering why I'm struggling

00:09:10.390 00:09:12.750
to do something big like assume some

00:09:13.300 00:09:14.639
underlying disability there which is

00:09:14.860 00:09:27.360
like kind of a weird like like stares

00:09:27.940 00:09:35.699
like super awkward like I wish I was on

00:09:35.860 00:09:54.180
my phone via bluetooth yeah well I think

00:09:54.610 00:09:56.970
that by the time I was finally diagnosed

00:09:57.130 00:09:57.900
with Parkinson's

00:09:58.000 00:10:02.310
I was so past the point of shock you

00:10:02.350 00:10:06.569
know it was six years into it but I

00:10:07.230 00:10:09.810
think more than the deines Parkinson's

00:10:10.000 00:10:12.780
but the realization that something was

00:10:13.149 00:10:14.460
really really wrong and it wasn't gonna

00:10:14.649 00:10:17.340
get better a couple months into being

00:10:19.770 00:10:22.310
sick it was it was kind of like

00:10:23.320 00:10:25.680
everything I knew changed and every

00:10:26.470 00:10:28.110
every all of the ways I lived my life

00:10:28.510 00:10:30.660
and all the ways I did things had to

00:10:31.770 00:10:33.900
change because they weren't gonna work

00:10:34.450 00:10:38.699
the same and so it's like I felt like I

00:10:38.860 00:10:40.260
almost had to rebuild my entire life

00:10:47.160 00:10:50.519
scratch yeah you know and this is like

00:10:50.770 00:10:52.170
as heard talked about recently I was I

00:10:52.600 00:10:56.340
was a singer I was there it was training

00:10:58.199 00:10:59.910
competitive singing and I wanted to be

00:10:59.980 00:11:02.490
an opera singer and I lost my voice very

00:11:03.220 00:11:07.350
early on and in in a really weird way

00:11:07.420 00:11:08.730
you know it was towards the end of my

00:11:08.890 00:11:09.780
first year of high school

00:11:10.360 00:11:12.720
so I was 14 you know and that when I was

00:11:13.060 00:11:14.520
15 starting my second year I was kind of

00:11:14.710 00:11:15.810
just like well I literally just lost

00:11:16.000 00:11:16.890
everything I thought I wanted to do with

00:11:16.990 00:11:20.130
my life and because I lost that I was in

00:11:20.290 00:11:22.950
this place too you know I had an amazing

00:11:23.110 00:11:25.680
art teacher and an amazing chemistry

00:11:26.260 00:11:27.720
teacher which are like the two things

00:11:27.880 00:11:30.150
that I do now you know ice went to

00:11:30.370 00:11:32.280
college for chemistry and then I just

00:11:33.010 00:11:35.670
create stuff as a recruit you know it's

00:11:35.800 00:11:39.510
my creative outlet artistic and crafty

00:11:39.880 00:11:41.010
pursuit there my creative outlet because

00:11:41.320 00:11:42.840
I feel like you can't just do science

00:11:43.210 00:11:47.820
without having something to keep you

00:11:48.010 00:11:48.990
can't just a Parkinson suppose something

00:11:49.120 00:11:51.770
to keep you going insane so you know

00:11:52.780 00:11:57.420
there but I found you know I needed

00:11:57.820 00:11:59.310
especially losing seeing and you did

00:11:59.470 00:12:00.840
that creative outlet and I had this an

00:12:00.970 00:12:02.310
amazing art teacher who just kind of

00:12:02.560 00:12:04.350
taught me how to you know how to see

00:12:04.540 00:12:06.240
things on how to be creative and then I

00:12:06.400 00:12:07.770
had this chemistry teacher who was

00:12:08.380 00:12:11.070
incredible and who like really saw that

00:12:11.140 00:12:12.840
I was good at it and then I was enjoying

00:12:13.150 00:12:14.750
it and really fostered that and like

00:12:15.760 00:12:16.980
because of those two people I had the

00:12:17.440 00:12:18.780
confidence to go to go off to college

00:12:18.970 00:12:21.840
and to uh you know to go try out the

00:12:22.000 00:12:24.930
world and to think that I could I could

00:12:25.270 00:12:26.880
succeed in so I was really lucky to be

00:12:27.010 00:12:29.820
in that place where I was having those

00:12:30.070 00:12:32.370
people but that's that's I think the one

00:12:32.650 00:12:34.890
the one advantage to having it so young

00:12:35.170 00:12:38.250
was that my idea of who I was wasn't

00:12:38.800 00:12:43.230
super solid yet I mean the disadvantage

00:12:43.450 00:12:45.510
was it was kind of you know it was

00:12:45.820 00:12:47.250
really hard to I think to be going after

00:12:47.560 00:12:49.700
those those really formative years and

00:12:50.710 00:12:53.310
to have something so huge and it's the

00:12:53.560 00:12:56.070
thing that was I feel like you know it's

00:12:56.140 00:12:57.570
just a continual trauma you know it's

00:13:01.290 00:13:08.060
like keeps on giving yeah it really is

00:13:09.070 00:13:11.010
yeah that's that's I guess that's about

00:13:11.590 00:13:18.020
having at this young age

00:13:19.030 00:13:22.940
yeah I vlog a blog bit I

00:13:23.430 00:13:25.370
that very much I think it was after I

00:13:25.530 00:13:28.070
had deep brain stimulation surgery which

00:13:28.170 00:13:32.780
I had in June 2015 after my DBS my

00:13:33.150 00:13:34.460
actually my neurosurgeon said this to me

00:13:34.680 00:13:36.440
said that you're one of the few people

00:13:36.840 00:13:38.150
who's had this at a young enough page

00:13:38.550 00:13:40.460
and the scientific background to where

00:13:40.590 00:13:41.780
you can talk about this from a

00:13:42.060 00:13:44.600
perspective that nobody else has and

00:13:44.880 00:13:46.010
that really stuck with me because I

00:13:46.380 00:13:48.080
realized that there was there was there

00:13:48.240 00:13:50.660
was something missing out there that I

00:13:51.120 00:13:53.570
felt like I was sort of in a unique

00:13:53.700 00:13:56.240
place to fill and I could take science

00:13:56.520 00:13:58.850
and digest it down to patients because

00:13:59.100 00:14:02.780
so much of my own my own getting through

00:14:03.300 00:14:04.640
Parkinson's has been through through

00:14:04.830 00:14:06.820
knowledge through learning everything

00:14:07.830 00:14:08.750
everything and everything that there was

00:14:09.270 00:14:10.760
about science and Parkinson's and

00:14:11.430 00:14:13.760
continuing to study it that gave me the

00:14:13.860 00:14:15.500
ability to dialogue an interface with

00:14:15.840 00:14:18.110
medical professionals in a new way that

00:14:18.420 00:14:19.940
somebody who doesn't know the basics of

00:14:20.100 00:14:22.630
how their medication work just can't do

00:14:23.640 00:14:25.340
and I felt like there's nothing out

00:14:25.380 00:14:26.810
there that was really sharing it in a

00:14:26.970 00:14:28.370
way so one of the projects I set out to

00:14:28.500 00:14:31.130
do was to do some Parkinson's education

00:14:32.120 00:14:34.490
videos which I've done a couple of and

00:14:34.830 00:14:37.070
I'm gonna keep doing now I have some new

00:14:37.650 00:14:38.720
topics I want to keep doing but then

00:14:38.910 00:14:40.610
also talking about some of the real

00:14:41.210 00:14:43.190
things I've talked about like what it's

00:14:43.320 00:14:44.450
like to be on the inside of DBS surgery

00:14:45.120 00:14:46.670
because the one thing nobody told me it

00:14:46.770 00:14:48.050
was how I was going to feel when they

00:14:48.120 00:15:00.020
were drilling in Cajun to my head it's

00:15:00.210 00:15:02.090
all it's it's it's little for me like

00:15:02.130 00:15:05.390
you it was it was it wasn't it's a mixed

00:15:05.610 00:15:07.370
bag on one hand it's such a cool thing

00:15:08.070 00:15:10.880
for me like I'm just fascinated by that

00:15:11.010 00:15:12.410
kind of stuff and the way I got through

00:15:12.630 00:15:14.450
it personally it was by knowing the

00:15:14.670 00:15:15.920
science it became something that I

00:15:16.380 00:15:17.570
studied instantly that I was like

00:15:18.000 00:15:19.700
emotionally detached from like the surge

00:15:20.280 00:15:21.920
didn't was I was just like right now

00:15:22.230 00:15:24.470
you're peeling back mind in geez and he

00:15:24.780 00:15:25.820
actually stopped with you just like how

00:15:25.890 00:15:27.470
do you he's like that is what I'm doing

00:15:27.630 00:15:29.150
like how do you know that I read the

00:15:29.580 00:15:32.540
technical manual before dessert you know

00:15:32.880 00:15:37.930
cuz of course I did

00:15:38.940 00:15:40.670
funny and I had this neurosurgeon who

00:15:40.829 00:15:42.710
was he was incredible and he was so

00:15:42.930 00:15:44.629
down-to-earth and he was just like I put

00:15:44.730 00:15:46.280
these in people all the time like and I

00:15:46.410 00:15:47.629
have no idea how they work on like a

00:15:48.120 00:15:50.030
chemical level that was like well let me

00:15:50.279 00:15:51.920
tell you about the quantum mechanics of

00:15:52.459 00:15:55.310
cell depolarization it's like we're

00:15:55.410 00:15:57.050
having this conversation about like cell

00:15:57.480 00:15:59.930
voltage potentials as he's like you know

00:16:00.930 00:16:04.160
drilling into my head but there are some

00:16:04.350 00:16:06.740
weird feelings there's some very weird

00:16:07.199 00:16:11.259
feelings in it and it's very surreal and

00:16:12.269 00:16:14.210
it's just it's an experience unlike any

00:16:14.370 00:16:16.220
other experience um the one thing that I

00:16:16.740 00:16:18.710
love is that I got to feel the moment

00:16:19.019 00:16:22.970
that my body started to work again it's

00:16:23.100 00:16:25.819
a moment that you know I will hold

00:16:26.100 00:16:28.639
forever is that they were trying to they

00:16:29.610 00:16:31.160
the moment he got it right was like oh

00:16:31.320 00:16:33.230
it was like an aha moment for my body it

00:16:33.389 00:16:35.689
was like he my arm was like locked like

00:16:35.970 00:16:37.939
here my hands were like claws on my arm

00:16:38.130 00:16:39.769
was just stuck because they also have

00:16:39.870 00:16:42.019
you off meds for a whole thing for like

00:16:42.209 00:16:44.180
I was barely walking to the building I

00:16:44.550 00:16:45.380
honestly I think I was just so

00:16:45.570 00:16:49.630
determined to walk into the building

00:16:50.670 00:16:52.819
yeah then putting the bracelet on me I

00:16:53.010 00:16:54.560
was just like because I had to give the

00:16:54.720 00:16:56.329
nurse my arm and I was like okay like

00:16:56.670 00:16:58.189
trying to grab it it's dragon she was

00:16:58.320 00:16:59.420
like are you okay and I was like why are

00:16:59.550 00:17:00.710
you asking me that I'm gonna brain

00:17:03.750 00:17:08.120
you know and but the moment it worked it

00:17:08.280 00:17:09.710
was like all of a sudden I was like they

00:17:09.870 00:17:11.809
were like point I was like whoa like hey

00:17:12.360 00:17:16.340
hey arm yeah and they were like point to

00:17:16.439 00:17:17.929
the anesthesiologist and I was like he's

00:17:18.209 00:17:20.990
over there you know and I had me tabbing

00:17:21.120 00:17:24.230
my ink before Danny mess and that was

00:17:24.360 00:17:27.169
just like I can tap my everything was so

00:17:27.660 00:17:30.110
exciting it was like it's like feeling

00:17:30.270 00:17:33.740
all these yeah it's it's it's pretty it

00:17:33.900 00:17:35.060
that that's the one that's one thing

00:17:35.250 00:17:36.560
that I think like makes that that's

00:17:36.929 00:17:42.440
totally makes it worth it like is it

00:17:48.180 00:17:51.140
right you get the baby is like yeah

00:17:51.870 00:17:55.340
least the the babies yeah you got that

00:17:55.620 00:17:56.960
after all benders or it kind of was

00:17:57.780 00:17:58.760
although then they and then they turn it

00:17:58.920 00:18:00.410
to I because they want to test kind of

00:18:00.570 00:18:03.620
like the voltage limits and for me and

00:18:04.020 00:18:05.300
everyone that that's the thing about DBS

00:18:05.460 00:18:07.340
is it's everyone feels different weird

00:18:07.980 00:18:09.860
sensations like every time they program

00:18:10.050 00:18:11.600
I and I feel like a twitch and my fourth

00:18:11.730 00:18:15.560
and fifth finger yeah it's so strange

00:18:15.720 00:18:17.090
every time they changed the programs for

00:18:17.160 00:18:20.120
a little bit and then it goes away

00:18:20.520 00:18:22.160
but like when they turn to get up I felt

00:18:22.320 00:18:24.710
like I felt heavy all of a sudden I felt

00:18:24.810 00:18:26.480
like my um I was pointing my you know

00:18:26.700 00:18:27.890
tonight Susie ologist and my hand my arm

00:18:27.960 00:18:30.230
just dropped and my legs and my face

00:18:30.540 00:18:31.970
drop and like because they didn't want

00:18:32.040 00:18:33.260
you know half the time my face dropped

00:18:33.450 00:18:34.970
and I was just like I was just I I

00:18:35.370 00:18:38.050
literally asked as it did I had a stroke

00:18:39.060 00:18:40.670
was having a stroke it was just like no

00:18:40.950 00:18:42.050
don't worry like we just turned it up

00:18:42.510 00:18:43.460
because we wanted to see you know it's

00:18:43.620 00:18:44.540
just a point where it was too high and I

00:18:44.670 00:18:49.130
was like well it's to my point so after

00:18:49.260 00:18:50.840
the initial amazement they kind of did

00:18:50.900 00:18:55.070
that you know off on and for a little

00:18:55.260 00:18:58.640
bit that was a little bit weird but yeah

00:18:58.830 00:19:01.340
it's a it's an experience are you

00:19:01.680 00:19:17.000
thinking about DBS surgery yeah yeah I

00:19:17.220 00:19:18.680
mean it was when I had it it was kind of

00:19:18.870 00:19:23.330
like it needed to happen my son so bad

00:19:24.000 00:19:27.470
um I was there were they were so bad

00:19:27.720 00:19:28.880
they were I mean I was getting somewhere

00:19:29.070 00:19:29.930
I was having a hard time getting out of

00:19:30.030 00:19:33.890
bed on my own so you know it was kind of

00:19:34.080 00:19:35.990
just like if I want to be functional at

00:19:37.010 00:19:41.770
all that needs to happen

00:19:42.780 00:19:45.020
yeah it was so effective it was like it

00:19:45.240 00:19:46.960
was I mean it's it's night and day it's

00:19:47.970 00:19:51.050
it's really it's really crazy like it's

00:19:51.240 00:19:53.120
good it's the point where my money

00:19:53.700 00:19:55.160
programmer doesn't even went to tweak

00:19:55.350 00:19:56.750
sit she doesn't turn it off anymore she

00:19:56.880 00:19:59.480
was just like I didn't want to see it we

00:19:59.700 00:20:00.390
know it's there

00:20:01.400 00:20:03.010
so she did it once and she was just like

00:20:03.230 00:20:14.409
I'm never turning us off again right and

00:20:14.510 00:20:15.669
then you read you're like they cut your

00:20:25.929 00:20:27.880
head that deep brain stimulation surgery

00:20:28.309 00:20:29.320
takes about two years to get comfortable

00:20:29.450 00:20:31.390
with the idea cuz it's so weird like

00:20:31.580 00:20:32.860
it's the weirdest one that I want to

00:20:32.960 00:20:34.360
know who the food the hell the first

00:20:34.760 00:20:40.990
person was to ever do this like the

00:20:41.030 00:20:43.570
first person back in 1998 who was like

00:20:44.000 00:20:48.000
yeah you want to stick these electrified

00:20:49.010 00:20:51.909
charts them high and see what happens

00:20:52.720 00:20:55.960
oh I mean it's it's crazy but it's it's

00:20:56.150 00:20:57.130
like I remember I went to a presentation

00:20:57.380 00:20:58.990
about two years before head surgery and

00:20:59.240 00:21:00.490
they passed around the electrode it's in

00:21:00.559 00:21:04.149
the lead I said oh hell no that was like

00:21:04.429 00:21:07.659
no way no way no way I never ever want

00:21:07.850 00:21:14.710
to do that when they when they way back

00:21:14.900 00:21:16.419
for a surgery I was like please cut my

00:21:16.549 00:21:32.470
head open they can tilt her head the

00:21:32.570 00:21:56.350
right way I felt really alone before my

00:21:56.870 00:21:59.860
diagnosis and actually um dope

00:22:00.470 00:22:01.539
responsive dystonia was the first

00:22:02.270 00:22:03.669
community I ever you know part of

00:22:04.070 00:22:06.940
because of my first diagnosis and it was

00:22:06.980 00:22:10.330
a Facebook group I found and all of a

00:22:10.549 00:22:11.710
sudden it was like I'm not alone in the

00:22:11.809 00:22:13.510
world like there's other people who have

00:22:14.469 00:22:16.419
problems and I hadn't really figured out

00:22:16.639 00:22:18.399
and I mean this was also this was 2012

00:22:18.679 00:22:19.869
where if you're I feel like that was

00:22:19.940 00:22:21.879
kind of the time when like Facebook

00:22:22.219 00:22:23.589
group and different communities were

00:22:23.960 00:22:27.669
finally like really emerging just before

00:22:27.859 00:22:30.009
that I mean I think I found an old form

00:22:30.139 00:22:33.969
of there's a couple years prior had been

00:22:34.070 00:22:35.409
on different forums but I feel like

00:22:36.349 00:22:38.019
Facebook just really enabled these

00:22:38.539 00:22:40.749
communities to really form but between

00:22:41.119 00:22:43.690
not having an actual diagnosis and like

00:22:43.999 00:22:45.639
you know kind of that lack of that

00:22:46.099 00:22:46.810
technology I didn't really have a

00:22:47.330 00:22:49.779
community when I wasn't diagnosed and

00:22:50.210 00:22:51.729
those years just felt really really high

00:22:52.309 00:22:54.159
slippin I didn't really feel like I mean

00:22:54.200 00:22:55.629
I have I had amazing friends who are

00:22:55.849 00:22:57.369
still super supportive who were still my

00:22:57.649 00:22:59.139
friends today but they didn't really

00:22:59.690 00:23:01.389
understand what was what I was going

00:23:01.460 00:23:03.129
through um and all of a sudden I find

00:23:03.320 00:23:04.570
was people who had really similar

00:23:05.269 00:23:07.690
experiences I was like oh my gosh

00:23:08.330 00:23:10.779
this this is amazing and then the other

00:23:11.179 00:23:12.269
the other side of the community that

00:23:13.279 00:23:14.109
hadn't gotten more and more involved in

00:23:14.179 00:23:15.489
the parkinson's community that I have

00:23:16.029 00:23:19.869
found is that I I really I really love

00:23:20.389 00:23:22.599
you know having you know done blogging

00:23:22.759 00:23:24.549
and vlogging and making videos and stuff

00:23:25.070 00:23:28.899
is that I really sort of see you know

00:23:29.149 00:23:30.789
the the the the privileges that I've had

00:23:31.190 00:23:32.589
having been able to study science having

00:23:32.719 00:23:34.869
been able to you know to understand this

00:23:35.779 00:23:37.779
been able to have this surgery and to do

00:23:38.089 00:23:40.289
different things I really feel like

00:23:41.299 00:23:42.789
obligated to share with the community

00:23:43.759 00:23:45.759
because so much of them sharing is how I

00:23:46.389 00:23:49.629
got to work and so I really feel that

00:23:49.940 00:23:53.739
sort of them that need to to kind of

00:23:53.989 00:23:55.209
give that back because they feel like

00:23:55.609 00:23:57.969
they've given so much to me and that

00:23:58.159 00:24:02.469
they just they were so supportive like

00:24:04.749 00:24:06.579
they're yeah I mean when I got to do a

00:24:06.769 00:24:08.950
dude from college was a it was a huge

00:24:09.229 00:24:13.359
you know when I graduated it was my

00:24:13.609 00:24:15.279
first my first you know there's the

00:24:15.409 00:24:16.839
eight semesters till my first five

00:24:17.119 00:24:21.009
semesters were like you know I was still

00:24:21.259 00:24:23.589
sort of functioning and then at the end

00:24:23.659 00:24:25.539
of October is when I got sick and on my

00:24:25.879 00:24:27.600
computer needs to be plugged in

00:24:30.780 00:24:36.020
or yeah I got I got sick towards the the

00:24:37.030 00:24:42.770
device of my fifth semester and and I

00:24:43.780 00:24:48.420
when that happens I it was like the next

00:24:48.670 00:24:51.150
three semesters I had the two had to DBS

00:24:51.790 00:24:54.900
procedures and a feeding tube pudding

00:24:55.510 00:24:57.480
the gastric complications is Parkinson's

00:24:57.670 00:25:00.450
that nearly hard and they were just so

00:25:00.760 00:25:02.400
rocky the last three semesters that when

00:25:02.440 00:25:05.220
I graduated it was like oh my god I

00:25:05.710 00:25:07.710
graduate and I was able to finish this

00:25:08.350 00:25:10.080
is a huge deal and they were like you

00:25:10.180 00:25:11.160
know they're there's so many people with

00:25:11.650 00:25:13.290
Parkinson's who my graduation was kind

00:25:13.360 00:25:17.430
of like their celebration to like they

00:25:17.830 00:25:19.200
were all everyone was like celebrating

00:25:19.420 00:25:21.480
this with me and it really felt like I

00:25:21.670 00:25:22.650
felt like this is an accomplishment that

00:25:22.810 00:25:23.910
we kind of all shared it was really

00:25:24.550 00:25:25.590
incredible and I feel like every time

00:25:26.560 00:25:28.260
somebody has a big joy like a big thing

00:25:28.420 00:25:29.850
that they've done like we all gonna be

00:25:30.340 00:25:48.540
happy with them I need rama's stupid

00:25:48.790 00:25:50.400
like it's just stupid things that and it

00:25:50.590 00:25:51.900
it doesn't mean anything you know and

00:25:52.060 00:25:55.140
it's like we're really are like we cry

00:25:55.330 00:25:59.700
together and we celebrate together it's

00:26:00.040 00:26:13.230
really lovely love to share yeah you

00:26:13.600 00:26:15.030
know I think the biggest thing I could

00:26:15.190 00:26:16.680
ever tell anybody who's been diagnosed

00:26:16.960 00:26:19.620
and ever and you know sometimes newly

00:26:19.990 00:26:22.980
diagnosed will contact me and I think

00:26:23.320 00:26:25.910
they're they're very overwhelmed because

00:26:26.920 00:26:28.470
it's like so much information coming at

00:26:28.630 00:26:30.000
you once like it's totally an

00:26:30.520 00:26:34.020
overwhelming thing and I think my

00:26:34.270 00:26:36.480
biggest advice is just to to you know

00:26:36.940 00:26:38.100
take a deep breath and say like okay on

00:26:38.200 00:26:39.930
how to conquer this on that day

00:26:40.300 00:26:41.820
and to just learn as much as you can

00:26:42.790 00:26:44.220
because I think the more knowledge you

00:26:44.560 00:26:46.140
have is the more power you have like

00:26:46.390 00:26:48.930
know your options learn how your your

00:26:49.450 00:26:51.090
medication works well you know learn

00:26:51.340 00:26:54.630
learn what's out there because you know

00:26:54.850 00:26:56.070
that gives you so much more power

00:26:56.850 00:26:59.430
um it gives you control that you you

00:26:59.650 00:27:04.110
don't have from this disease and you

00:27:04.360 00:27:06.750
know and I think it's it's a combination

00:27:07.060 00:27:09.240
of balancing all of the come the bad I

00:27:09.430 00:27:10.230
also like to tell people I'm like I'm

00:27:10.330 00:27:11.220
not pretty my symptoms are pretty

00:27:12.040 00:27:13.650
extreme and like my fairly extreme

00:27:14.140 00:27:16.940
example like I'm totally not I'm not the

00:27:18.930 00:27:23.610
usual don't be afraid yeah that is true

00:27:24.040 00:27:25.320
but you know it's kind of just like I'm

00:27:25.870 00:27:27.240
like you know you know in ten years in

00:27:27.400 00:27:30.180
you could still be doing okay you know

00:27:30.850 00:27:33.180
and you might not be but it's also it's

00:27:33.490 00:27:35.550
so out of your control like whatever is

00:27:35.710 00:27:36.930
gonna happen symptom eyes it's gonna

00:27:37.180 00:27:38.730
happen symptom wise you can be prepared

00:27:38.980 00:27:41.550
for it by knowing what's gonna happen

00:27:41.680 00:27:43.410
and also any there's there's a huge

00:27:43.600 00:27:45.540
amount of acceptance that comes with PD

00:27:45.880 00:27:50.340
and that's a slow process and don't be

00:27:50.500 00:27:52.140
those overwhelming moments of like my

00:27:52.330 00:27:53.580
life is falling apart and everything is

00:27:53.980 00:27:57.540
awful and my other I think advice you

00:27:57.730 00:27:59.280
would speak to like you really have to

00:27:59.410 00:28:01.500
let yourself feel those into like you

00:28:01.690 00:28:03.060
are losing something when you have PD

00:28:03.430 00:28:06.270
your I think the there's an amount of

00:28:06.760 00:28:08.010
grieving you have to do for the life you

00:28:08.320 00:28:11.670
thought you were gonna live but you know

00:28:11.830 00:28:13.410
at the same time I think that

00:28:13.870 00:28:15.030
celebrating the community is the best

00:28:15.280 00:28:17.430
advice I can give because it's really an

00:28:17.830 00:28:21.870
incredible community and it's one I'm I

00:28:22.120 00:28:24.390
feel really fortunate to be part of in a

00:28:24.550 00:28:27.630
weird twisted way it's like we really

00:28:27.970 00:28:30.150
have a horrible disease but at the same

00:28:30.460 00:28:32.190
time like I wouldn't know all these

00:28:32.970 00:28:35.370
people if I didn't have Parkinson's and

00:28:35.530 00:28:37.560
we wouldn't have that that it's it's the

00:28:37.870 00:28:42.740
crappy jealous altogether

00:28:43.750 00:28:46.650
develop morbid sense of humor help you a

00:28:47.020 00:28:49.610
lot of things

00:28:50.429 00:28:51.649
you know you have to sometimes get

00:28:51.900 00:28:53.240
people into laughs when you're like you

00:28:53.490 00:28:54.830
know when you've laid on the ground for

00:28:55.200 00:28:56.450
six hours waiting for somebody to come

00:29:02.870 00:29:04.039
home you know

00:29:04.380 00:29:05.870
you're like I'm on the floor this is

00:29:06.179 00:29:07.700
just great like but you know it's it's

00:29:08.010 00:29:16.580
it's like afterwards it catches you

00:29:17.039 00:29:27.010
anytime you fall right
