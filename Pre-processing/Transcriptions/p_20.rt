00:00:00.719 00:00:02.450
good morning I just wanted to start

00:00:02.790 00:00:04.249
talking about some of my rehab program

00:00:04.529 00:00:05.480
and what I've been doing to reverse

00:00:06.060 00:00:07.670
Parkinson's disease and one of the

00:00:08.040 00:00:09.320
biggest changes for me came when I

00:00:09.690 00:00:11.089
started doing work with eye tracking I

00:00:11.519 00:00:13.419
had gone back to see dr. Farris and

00:00:14.429 00:00:15.680
Toronto and he had pointed out that my

00:00:15.719 00:00:17.420
eye tracking was actually really slow

00:00:17.789 00:00:19.730
and that I would jump when I was trying

00:00:19.830 00:00:21.759
to follow something so I would end up

00:00:22.769 00:00:24.349
tracking something to the edge and then

00:00:24.420 00:00:25.580
I would jump to the other side without

00:00:26.130 00:00:27.140
following the whole finger along the way

00:00:27.510 00:00:29.300
and so I started doing eye tracking

00:00:29.970 00:00:31.220
probably only a couple minutes a day

00:00:32.189 00:00:33.319
it's important that you don't do too

00:00:33.510 00:00:35.360
much or you start to get dizzy or you

00:00:35.550 00:00:38.090
can get some vertigo from it but one of

00:00:38.219 00:00:39.860
the problems with Parkinson's disease is

00:00:40.140 00:00:41.930
that the communication between the left

00:00:42.149 00:00:43.610
brain and the right brain is actually

00:00:43.950 00:00:47.479
quite slow and so that causes a lot of

00:00:47.700 00:00:50.330
problems both with mobility and with

00:00:50.700 00:00:52.369
actually eye tracking and one of the

00:00:52.590 00:00:54.020
things that I'd noticed was when I was

00:00:54.270 00:00:56.450
driving I actually had a lot of anxiety

00:00:57.180 00:00:58.430
because I think I wasn't able to see the

00:00:58.680 00:00:59.860
things around me and so my anxiety

00:01:00.870 00:01:02.330
significantly reduced as soon as I was

00:01:02.370 00:01:04.149
able to address the eye tracking as well

00:01:05.720 00:01:07.490
so the best way to work with eye

00:01:07.619 00:01:09.289
tracking is actually to lie on your back

00:01:09.600 00:01:11.000
because it's very tempting to just have

00:01:11.130 00:01:13.609
your head follow your eye as opposed to

00:01:14.460 00:01:15.950
just your eyes following your fingers

00:01:17.600 00:01:19.999
and usually I'll start and just go to

00:01:20.159 00:01:22.940
the edge of my field of what I can see

00:01:23.250 00:01:26.620
and then follow the eye back and forth

00:01:27.630 00:01:28.850
trying not to move the head as much as

00:01:29.490 00:01:30.649
possible I know in this position I moved

00:01:30.780 00:01:32.929
the head a little bit and when I first

00:01:33.060 00:01:34.580
was doing this I could only track really

00:01:35.009 00:01:36.830
slow I couldn't track fast so I started

00:01:36.990 00:01:38.390
out really slow and just tried to really

00:01:38.700 00:01:41.530
follow my finger and then doing circles

00:01:43.040 00:01:45.560
and following every part of the circle

00:01:45.780 00:01:47.600
not jumping ahead or behind in both

00:01:48.030 00:01:50.179
directions and now a lot of what I do is

00:01:50.399 00:01:52.399
kind of zig zaggy all over the place and

00:01:53.159 00:01:54.410
trying to do different patterns and

00:01:54.689 00:01:56.870
doing fast and doing slow it's a little

00:01:57.060 00:01:58.399
harder to demonstrate without lying down

00:01:59.159 00:02:01.130
but just doing a couple minutes of this

00:02:01.200 00:02:03.139
a day can actually make a significant

00:02:03.270 00:02:04.580
difference of how well your brain is

00:02:04.829 00:02:06.770
processing in anxiety

00:02:07.079 00:02:08.839
and actually in reversing some of the

00:02:09.149 00:02:11.539
Parkinson's symptoms
