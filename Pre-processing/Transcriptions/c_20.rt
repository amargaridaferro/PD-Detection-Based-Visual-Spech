00:00:00.480 00:00:02.629
every single person who ever existed

00:00:03.540 00:00:05.660
began life as an embryonic stem cell

00:00:06.509 00:00:08.900
stem cells are a particular type of cell

00:00:09.389 00:00:11.930
which have the capacity to divide but in

00:00:12.030 00:00:13.520
the process of dividing they also

00:00:13.920 00:00:15.770
produce cells that can turn into other

00:00:16.020 00:00:17.750
types of cells in the body stem cells

00:00:18.359 00:00:19.820
for bark seeds I think have two major

00:00:20.670 00:00:21.950
exciting new developments one is the use

00:00:22.230 00:00:23.950
of them for treating the disease

00:00:24.960 00:00:25.609
transplanting them in the brain to

00:00:25.949 00:00:27.320
replace the lost dopamine cells the

00:00:27.480 00:00:29.210
other is this new technology which has

00:00:29.369 00:00:31.370
been around now for about a decade where

00:00:31.500 00:00:34.400
you can reprogram adult cells cells in

00:00:34.500 00:00:36.920
the body back to stem cells and then

00:00:37.170 00:00:38.270
turn them into any cell that you want

00:00:38.790 00:00:41.750
the great excitement I have for stem

00:00:42.090 00:00:44.889
cells is the potential to change the

00:00:45.899 00:00:47.330
natural history of treated Parkinson's

00:00:47.610 00:00:49.520
the stem cell derived dopamine cells

00:00:49.980 00:00:51.410
which I think will come to clinic in the

00:00:51.629 00:00:53.779
next few years are designed to replace

00:00:54.149 00:00:56.270
and repair the lost dopamine cells they

00:00:56.399 00:00:58.430
are not a cure the disease will still

00:00:58.800 00:01:02.119
carry on however my vision on this is

00:01:02.460 00:01:04.189
that in the future when people get

00:01:04.769 00:01:05.960
diagnosed with Parkinson's they could

00:01:06.180 00:01:07.789
have a stem cell derived dopamine

00:01:08.400 00:01:09.620
transplant you obviously won't need to

00:01:09.810 00:01:11.270
take any drugs because the dopamine

00:01:11.580 00:01:13.070
cells will be doing the job that the

00:01:13.320 00:01:14.480
drugs are currently doing so you'll

00:01:14.729 00:01:16.280
avoid all the complications of the drug

00:01:16.530 00:01:17.690
therapy they will go back almost

00:01:18.270 00:01:19.700
entirely to normal with these dopamine

00:01:20.070 00:01:21.830
and cell based therapies and obviously

00:01:21.990 00:01:23.719
the disease may catch up with them after

00:01:23.759 00:01:26.060
a period of time but nevertheless for a

00:01:26.310 00:01:28.700
large number of patients that 15 20

00:01:29.009 00:01:30.380
years they get with that cell based

00:01:30.780 00:01:32.359
therapy in effect will be a will be a

00:01:32.670 00:01:48.020
cure for them
