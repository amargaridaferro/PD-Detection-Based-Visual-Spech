00:00:09.370 00:00:10.680
so now I'm going to talk about the four

00:00:10.900 00:00:12.990
main factors that influence function

00:00:13.960 00:00:17.820
number one the person that's you you are

00:00:18.280 00:00:20.370
unique you bring your interests your

00:00:21.130 00:00:22.800
passions your work and your

00:00:24.029 00:00:25.700
relationships you have your physical

00:00:26.710 00:00:28.230
cognitive emotional strengths and

00:00:28.689 00:00:30.870
limitations you have other conditions

00:00:31.779 00:00:34.350
affecting you which may or may not have

00:00:34.510 00:00:37.860
been made worse by your Parkinson's then

00:00:38.110 00:00:39.720
you have the direct effects of

00:00:40.059 00:00:43.160
Parkinson's I think we're all pretty

00:00:44.170 00:00:47.100
familiar with the motor effects of

00:00:47.379 00:00:49.830
Parkinson's those motor symptoms most

00:00:50.379 00:00:55.430
common being tremor stiffness slowness

00:00:56.440 00:00:58.830
problems with coordination problems with

00:01:00.660 00:01:02.939
balance then there are the non-motor

00:01:03.899 00:01:06.149
symptoms there are really too many to

00:01:06.459 00:01:08.580
mention but I'll name a few

00:01:09.069 00:01:11.519
so sleep disturbances which can also

00:01:11.979 00:01:15.559
lead to daytime fatigue digestion

00:01:16.569 00:01:18.089
problems starting with chewing and

00:01:18.310 00:01:20.550
swallowing and working their ways all

00:01:21.009 00:01:22.949
their way all the way down to the gut

00:01:23.499 00:01:24.719
and the slowness of the god or

00:01:26.670 00:01:30.179
constipation attention span the speed of

00:01:31.469 00:01:36.239
thinking mood changes pain often in the

00:01:37.380 00:01:40.589
shoulder the back sometimes in the feet

00:01:41.409 00:01:44.219
sometimes in the neck visual issues

00:01:45.130 00:01:47.419
often that would be double vision or

00:01:48.429 00:01:52.169
difficulty seeing contrasts lack of

00:01:52.659 00:01:54.569
expression that can take many forms that

00:01:54.819 00:01:58.019
can be your facial expressions or it

00:01:58.509 00:02:01.229
could be the changes in your voice when

00:02:01.809 00:02:03.929
you try to express yourself verbally it

00:02:04.630 00:02:08.479
could be your gestures dizziness and

00:02:09.489 00:02:11.750
there are so many others

00:02:12.760 00:02:14.610
one that I want to make particular note

00:02:14.830 00:02:19.830
of is sensation that's what you need in

00:02:20.019 00:02:21.960
order to keep track of where your body

00:02:22.329 00:02:26.610
parts are and what they're doing so a

00:02:26.980 00:02:29.910
part of that involves those automatic

00:02:30.519 00:02:31.740
movements that should be occurring

00:02:32.019 00:02:34.100
without you having to think about them

00:02:35.110 00:02:36.780
you've practiced them all of your life

00:02:37.720 00:02:39.300
you aren't even aware that you're doing

00:02:39.489 00:02:41.580
them but they're very important to your

00:02:42.510 00:02:44.729
functioning some of those that you've

00:02:45.069 00:02:46.589
probably already heard about would be

00:02:47.140 00:02:50.599
arm swing is diminished with Parkinsons

00:02:51.609 00:02:53.640
posture is hard to maintain it feels

00:02:53.920 00:02:56.449
like you're always being pulled down

00:02:58.470 00:03:00.780
forward visual scanning even just

00:03:01.150 00:03:03.030
looking at what you're doing sometimes

00:03:03.519 00:03:04.949
doesn't occur as automatically as it

00:03:05.260 00:03:09.059
should and of course the footwork that

00:03:09.459 00:03:12.420
you turn your foot or you you place your

00:03:12.730 00:03:15.390
feet where you want them before you

00:03:15.430 00:03:19.890
start to move then there's this thing

00:03:19.930 00:03:24.689
called under scaled effort and you see

00:03:24.940 00:03:27.089
that whenever you watch somebody trying

00:03:27.160 00:03:29.699
to get out of a chair if it takes them

00:03:30.389 00:03:35.099
three tries to really get up you know

00:03:35.980 00:03:39.000
that the first two lacked significant

00:03:39.549 00:03:41.759
effort they didn't put enough oomph into

00:03:42.160 00:03:44.759
it to get out of the chair of course

00:03:44.949 00:03:47.220
there's another problem that they we're

00:03:47.470 00:03:49.050
probably experiencing too with body

00:03:49.269 00:03:51.319
mechanics but I'll get into that later

00:03:52.329 00:03:54.330
the other product sensation that happens

00:03:54.609 00:03:56.220
is that you might be able to make a good

00:03:56.739 00:04:01.220
first effort but then as you go along

00:04:02.230 00:04:05.220
that effort diminishes you see this a

00:04:05.500 00:04:08.009
lot with walking so you can take a nice

00:04:08.409 00:04:12.180
big step to start but then each step

00:04:12.489 00:04:13.979
after that gets smaller and smaller

00:04:14.979 00:04:16.289
especially if you're distracted from

00:04:16.810 00:04:17.680
thinking about your step

00:04:17.780 00:04:20.140
and pretty soon you get that shuffling

00:04:20.600 00:04:22.960
sound and you know what that means

00:04:23.060 00:04:24.820
it means that your feet just really

00:04:25.160 00:04:26.680
aren't you're not really picking up your

00:04:26.990 00:04:28.770
feet and moving them in a big way

00:04:29.780 00:04:33.270
alright so using some basic principles

00:04:34.280 00:04:37.030
we can begin to address some of the

00:04:37.070 00:04:40.560
issues that are common to Parkinson's

00:04:41.570 00:04:44.920
one of them is your base of support so

00:04:45.530 00:04:49.630
where are your feet if they're nice and

00:04:50.180 00:04:53.230
wide you're going to be able to move

00:04:54.230 00:04:56.500
freely without feeling like you're gonna

00:04:56.870 00:04:59.950
fall over if not if they're close

00:05:00.380 00:05:02.830
together or tucked underneath you you're

00:05:02.960 00:05:04.690
gonna laugh the stability that you need

00:05:05.300 00:05:06.640
even for something that doesn't seem

00:05:07.010 00:05:10.720
related like handwriting or getting

00:05:11.210 00:05:13.240
dressed you really need to have the

00:05:13.490 00:05:15.310
stability of your feet on the floor in

00:05:15.980 00:05:18.310
order to feel confident about the other

00:05:18.710 00:05:19.810
things that you're trying to concentrate

00:05:20.590 00:05:24.430
on so weight shifts weight shifts allow

00:05:24.500 00:05:27.820
you to take your weight off of one foot

00:05:28.730 00:05:32.440
in order to move it if your weight is

00:05:32.990 00:05:35.530
dead center on both feet you really

00:05:35.960 00:05:38.770
can't move this one effectively and so

00:05:38.840 00:05:42.460
you begin to rely on tipping yourself

00:05:42.830 00:05:45.220
forward in order to get the feet to move

00:05:45.530 00:05:48.370
and that's not only ineffective it's

00:05:50.200 00:05:52.120
dangerous so the other thing about

00:05:52.520 00:05:54.630
weight shifts is it allows you to move

00:05:55.640 00:05:59.680
well from one position to another so if

00:06:00.020 00:06:04.110
I'm sitting my weight is all on my hips

00:06:05.120 00:06:07.540
but if I want to stand I need to get

00:06:08.060 00:06:11.320
half of my weight in front of my feet so

00:06:11.510 00:06:13.570
that means that I really have to push

00:06:14.450 00:06:18.240
low and way forward to get my weight out

00:06:19.250 00:06:21.220
my upper body weight out in front of my

00:06:21.560 00:06:23.010
feet and that's gonna

00:06:23.729 00:06:27.210
out my hips a lot of people when they

00:06:27.280 00:06:30.779
think about standing are just thinking

00:06:30.910 00:06:34.740
about going straight up and they don't

00:06:35.139 00:06:38.820
shift the weight so it makes the task a

00:06:39.099 00:06:42.330
whole lot harder for them you can do it

00:06:42.520 00:06:45.589
by pushing up but you're using an

00:06:46.599 00:06:48.210
extraordinary extraordinary amount of

00:06:48.550 00:06:51.029
effort to do it alright the next one is

00:06:51.789 00:06:52.379
rotational movements

00:06:52.930 00:06:54.809
those are nice for loosening up the

00:06:55.979 00:06:57.839
joints helping you feel like you can

00:06:58.060 00:07:00.529
move better but they also give you power

00:07:01.539 00:07:05.490
so if you think about baseball player if

00:07:06.009 00:07:09.719
they were to just stand there and move

00:07:09.940 00:07:11.820
the bat back and forth they have no

00:07:12.270 00:07:15.870
power when a 95 mile an hour ball comes

00:07:16.180 00:07:18.149
at them they're not going to be very

00:07:18.780 00:07:21.719
successful so what they do is they

00:07:22.360 00:07:24.540
rotate and then they push through and

00:07:25.389 00:07:28.620
that gets the whole body involved in the

00:07:29.259 00:07:30.420
activity and gives them the power they

00:07:32.400 00:07:35.370
need we talked about the word amplitude

00:07:35.590 00:07:37.700
in therapy and what that really means

00:07:38.710 00:07:41.629
it's just a big word that means bigness

00:07:42.639 00:07:45.420
so the size of your movements you want

00:07:45.639 00:07:47.999
your movements whether they're large or

00:07:48.520 00:07:51.570
small to be as big as they can be so how

00:07:51.639 00:07:53.189
do we do that how do you make a small

00:07:53.830 00:07:55.560
movement bigger well say you're going to

00:07:56.050 00:07:58.830
make a fist that's a small movement and

00:07:58.990 00:08:01.170
you can do it like this or you can do it

00:08:01.360 00:08:02.420
like that

00:08:03.430 00:08:05.749
so that's amplitude I'm putting I'm

00:08:06.759 00:08:08.999
putting a lot of effort into that and

00:08:09.669 00:08:12.629
I'm also going to the full extent of the

00:08:13.150 00:08:14.490
movement I'm getting it as tight as I

00:08:14.560 00:08:17.730
can get it the same goes for the big

00:08:18.039 00:08:20.879
move so the opposite of tight squeeze is

00:08:21.880 00:08:25.050
big and open you can do it with your

00:08:25.270 00:08:27.270
whole body you can get your face into it

00:08:27.780 00:08:30.210
by squeezing really tight and

00:08:31.220 00:08:34.509
opening really big or you can just do it

00:08:34.640 00:08:37.480
with your whole body all at once really

00:08:38.080 00:08:41.079
tight really big why do we do that looks

00:08:41.360 00:08:44.440
kind of weird we do it because we want

00:08:44.810 00:08:48.220
you to feel what's going on in your body

00:08:48.730 00:08:51.970
and the last basic principle or thing

00:08:52.130 00:08:53.710
that we tend to look at is therapists

00:08:53.899 00:08:58.090
this posture why there are so many

00:08:58.660 00:09:02.440
reasons if you have a person bent

00:09:03.670 00:09:08.230
forward then their their head and their

00:09:08.480 00:09:10.120
shoulders are always going to be out in

00:09:10.399 00:09:11.829
front of their feet and their feet are

00:09:12.050 00:09:13.630
going to have to shuffle to keep up with

00:09:13.880 00:09:17.139
them so you're already off-balance if

00:09:18.140 00:09:20.170
your posture is bent forward and that's

00:09:20.390 00:09:23.470
a typical Parkinson's posture is to have

00:09:23.510 00:09:26.410
a slight bend in the knees and the hips

00:09:26.870 00:09:30.370
a slight curve forward in in the

00:09:32.350 00:09:35.170
shoulders pain is another reason why you

00:09:35.450 00:09:38.860
want to have good posture if your

00:09:39.350 00:09:41.920
shoulders are slumped forward and you're

00:09:42.140 00:09:43.600
sitting kind of like they call it a

00:09:44.360 00:09:47.740
cashewnut posture then what you have to

00:09:48.079 00:09:50.530
do to make eye contact is to lift your

00:09:50.810 00:09:53.250
chin up and that's going to create a

00:09:54.260 00:09:55.569
little dip in the back of your neck

00:09:55.850 00:09:57.280
that's bigger than it really should be

00:09:58.149 00:10:01.269
and over time that can cause a lot of

00:10:01.550 00:10:04.660
neck pain same for any other part of

00:10:04.820 00:10:07.870
your posture if if your posture is not

00:10:08.300 00:10:12.300
good it's going to cause pain somewhere

00:10:13.310 00:10:15.310
increasing your lung capacity so you can

00:10:15.949 00:10:18.720
imagine if your posture is forward

00:10:19.730 00:10:22.630
flexed it's going to squish those lungs

00:10:23.120 00:10:24.790
and you're not going to have the same

00:10:25.550 00:10:28.090
capacity as if you were upright chest up

00:10:28.160 00:10:31.600
shoulders back you've got all this air

00:10:32.269 00:10:35.350
exchange that's possible so that can be

00:10:35.870 00:10:39.030
helpful for certainly aerobic fitness

00:10:40.040 00:10:41.410
but it can also be helpful for other

00:10:41.570 00:10:43.020
things like this

00:10:43.450 00:10:46.830
your swallow or the volume in your voice

00:10:47.290 00:10:49.350
you have to have a lot of air exchange

00:10:50.020 00:10:54.840
in order to have volume having good

00:10:55.950 00:10:57.960
posture automatically tells to your

00:10:58.360 00:11:00.090
nervous system that you need to pay

00:11:00.820 00:11:04.560
attention it's very much like standing

00:11:04.750 00:11:07.290
at attention if you were a soldier when

00:11:07.510 00:11:09.690
you're in that upright position your

00:11:09.940 00:11:12.690
body somehow knows that you need to pay

00:11:12.730 00:11:15.480
attention to what's going on and of

00:11:15.730 00:11:18.240
course it helps you to make direct eye

00:11:19.090 00:11:21.030
contact with the person with whom you're

00:11:21.070 00:11:24.060
speaking and so you can communicate more

00:11:25.290 00:11:29.490
effectively you can also scan down the

00:11:30.360 00:11:32.910
pathway that you're walking and and see

00:11:33.160 00:11:34.590
what's in front of you as opposed to

00:11:34.810 00:11:36.240
when your head is turned down because

00:11:36.610 00:11:38.130
your shoulders are slumped forward or

00:11:38.290 00:11:40.410
your hips are bent forward and it's

00:11:40.720 00:11:42.270
almost like you're looking down through

00:11:42.310 00:11:45.510
a periscope you have no plan for what's

00:11:45.730 00:11:48.060
in front of you if you can't look down

00:11:48.280 00:11:50.250
the road and see it but once you've

00:11:50.650 00:11:52.440
glanced in front of you your brain is so

00:11:52.930 00:11:58.760
quick to develop a plan of action and

00:11:59.770 00:12:02.190
then if those aren't good enough reasons

00:12:02.590 00:12:06.540
I will say that this probably looks

00:12:06.930 00:12:12.240
better than that other factors having to

00:12:12.460 00:12:14.880
do with you the person might be your

00:12:15.310 00:12:19.020
overall physical conditioning how active

00:12:19.270 00:12:22.290
are you with your what we call in

00:12:22.930 00:12:24.420
occupational therapy activities of daily

00:12:24.640 00:12:28.260
living or ADL's are you still trying to

00:12:28.540 00:12:30.780
do as much as you can for yourself in

00:12:30.970 00:12:34.280
your home with your personal care etc

00:12:35.290 00:12:37.170
what kinds of exercises are most

00:12:37.390 00:12:39.960
beneficial for you now if you're a

00:12:41.550 00:12:43.680
weightlifter you might think that bicep

00:12:44.050 00:12:45.120
curls are the things that you've always

00:12:45.490 00:12:46.790
done we love doing them and

00:12:47.100 00:12:49.310
really important but with Parkinson's

00:12:49.529 00:12:51.139
you may never need to do another bicep

00:12:51.420 00:12:53.060
curl in your life what you really need

00:12:53.220 00:12:55.730
to do is strengthen those muscles on the

00:12:56.399 00:12:59.090
opposite side of your body those ones

00:12:59.220 00:13:04.220
that hold you up right another factor

00:13:04.260 00:13:06.560
that I think is really interesting and

00:13:07.350 00:13:09.230
important to look at when we're dealing

00:13:09.829 00:13:12.050
with what people need to change about

00:13:12.360 00:13:15.440
themselves is how good are they at dual

00:13:16.260 00:13:19.269
tasking we call this multitask training

00:13:20.279 00:13:23.269
most everything we do involves divided

00:13:23.959 00:13:26.990
attention so I'm walking and then

00:13:27.360 00:13:30.350
looking I'm walking and I'm talking I'm

00:13:31.140 00:13:33.290
walking and I'm thinking I'm walking and

00:13:33.450 00:13:37.220
I'm carrying things people with

00:13:38.070 00:13:40.190
Parkinson's have to devote a lot more of

00:13:40.380 00:13:42.259
their conscious effort to keep track of

00:13:42.600 00:13:44.870
their posture and where their feet and

00:13:45.209 00:13:48.889
hands are so distractions can actually

00:13:49.079 00:13:50.750
be kind of dangerous if you're not

00:13:52.130 00:13:54.170
prepared freezing of gait you may have

00:13:54.390 00:13:56.120
heard of is very common among people

00:13:56.700 00:13:58.970
with Parkinson's who have trouble making

00:13:59.430 00:14:01.910
quick decisions about where and how to

00:14:03.350 00:14:06.290
move so it's really important that you

00:14:06.600 00:14:08.900
practice being able to make those quick

00:14:09.720 00:14:12.079
shifts in your speed and direction of

00:14:12.270 00:14:14.480
movement and also be able to quickly

00:14:14.940 00:14:16.940
shift your attention from one thing to

00:14:17.130 00:14:20.150
the next I think driving is probably the

00:14:20.700 00:14:24.710
ultimate challenge in balancing out or

00:14:25.170 00:14:26.660
holding multiple trains of thought at

00:14:26.820 00:14:30.050
one time all right the next thing that

00:14:30.329 00:14:33.079
we look at the next factor is the method

00:14:33.329 00:14:35.269
or the way you go about doing what

00:14:35.490 00:14:37.819
you're going to do we've already talked

00:14:37.980 00:14:40.280
about foot placement and posture so I

00:14:40.470 00:14:42.319
won't go into that any more but that is

00:14:42.750 00:14:44.960
part of the method of how you do things

00:14:45.269 00:14:47.060
and it's usually the first thing I look

00:14:47.250 00:14:52.300
at I my my eyes go directly to your feet

00:14:53.310 00:14:54.740
so some other things that you might want

00:14:55.020 00:14:57.689
to do or might want to take a look at

00:14:57.850 00:14:59.609
to know if your methods are as good as

00:14:59.859 00:15:03.809
they can be are you able to stay focused

00:15:04.269 00:15:06.720
on the task there are some little

00:15:07.449 00:15:09.109
strategies that can help with this

00:15:10.119 00:15:11.609
sometimes if you just verbalize what

00:15:12.189 00:15:15.900
you're gonna do I am going to reach all

00:15:16.419 00:15:19.739
the way back behind my shoulders and I'm

00:15:19.899 00:15:22.349
gonna grab that short shirt with a

00:15:22.899 00:15:24.989
really firm grip I'm going to take it

00:15:25.179 00:15:27.479
all the way up and over until I get down

00:15:27.519 00:15:29.759
to my knees on the other side and my

00:15:30.009 00:15:32.159
shirt just magically pops off with so

00:15:32.639 00:15:35.429
much greater speed and less effort than

00:15:35.679 00:15:38.220
it would have otherwise so another part

00:15:38.379 00:15:40.769
of that is just being really dramatic in

00:15:40.929 00:15:43.289
your movements make them bigger than

00:15:43.509 00:15:47.189
what you think another strategy might be

00:15:47.889 00:15:51.749
if your steps are too small is to look

00:15:51.939 00:15:55.769
ahead at where you're going and estimate

00:15:56.499 00:15:58.289
how many steps do I think it's gonna

00:15:58.720 00:16:01.879
take me to get from from here to there

00:16:02.889 00:16:05.129
that can be incredibly effective for

00:16:05.529 00:16:08.549
somebody who tends to have freezing of

00:16:08.589 00:16:12.329
gait or really shuffling steps another

00:16:12.759 00:16:16.319
strategy is to stop when you get into a

00:16:16.649 00:16:19.799
difficult situation like a crowded room

00:16:20.019 00:16:21.329
where you're going to have to make a lot

00:16:21.369 00:16:24.689
of maneuvers to get from the entrance to

00:16:24.939 00:16:26.279
the chair where you're going to sit and

00:16:26.859 00:16:31.259
you can actually stop and pre plan your

00:16:31.600 00:16:34.049
route I'm going to go forward till I get

00:16:34.299 00:16:37.169
to that place then I'm going to take two

00:16:37.419 00:16:39.299
steps to the side then I'm going to go

00:16:39.609 00:16:43.259
forward again and I'm going to stand in

00:16:43.329 00:16:47.189
front of my chair it can be as simple as

00:16:48.519 00:16:51.720
but it takes conscious thought all right

00:16:52.980 00:16:55.049
sequencing this is one of my personal

00:16:55.569 00:16:57.720
favorites because I always think of

00:16:58.329 00:17:00.829
airplane landings when people go to sit

00:17:01.839 00:17:04.220
airplane landings are when you're

00:17:05.230 00:17:06.870
thinking you're probably in a hurry

00:17:07.030 00:17:10.370
you're thinking more about getting your

00:17:11.380 00:17:14.160
hips to land on that chair then you are

00:17:14.589 00:17:17.160
about all the steps along the way that

00:17:17.319 00:17:20.640
that requires the first one is to walk

00:17:20.890 00:17:22.710
over to the chair and stand in front of

00:17:22.839 00:17:26.910
it no doubt you've had pts or OTS who

00:17:27.040 00:17:30.000
have said always make sure that you can

00:17:30.310 00:17:32.610
feel the back are the chair with the

00:17:32.800 00:17:35.850
back of your legs and that is true what

00:17:36.010 00:17:37.920
they're really saying is go stand right

00:17:38.260 00:17:40.890
in front of that chair don't even think

00:17:41.020 00:17:43.680
about sitting until you're standing

00:17:43.870 00:17:46.110
where you need to stand your feet again

00:17:46.270 00:17:48.390
your feet need to be in the right place

00:17:49.180 00:17:50.880
then you put your landing gear in order

00:17:51.490 00:17:55.730
you bow down you reach back and you sit

00:17:56.740 00:17:59.820
body mechanics is another strategy we've

00:18:00.130 00:18:01.680
talked a little bit already about this

00:18:02.080 00:18:04.620
with sit-to-stand you can do it with all

00:18:05.290 00:18:07.110
activities really but using good body

00:18:07.360 00:18:09.480
mechanics requires so much less less

00:18:10.380 00:18:12.750
effort if say you want to get out of the

00:18:13.170 00:18:16.110
chair you're going to try to get your

00:18:16.390 00:18:20.490
body to go low and forward to get you

00:18:20.770 00:18:22.470
out of the chair but what most people

00:18:22.600 00:18:26.160
are thinking about is standing up and so

00:18:26.320 00:18:28.260
they put all of their effort into trying

00:18:28.480 00:18:33.450
to lift themselves up however that's

00:18:33.790 00:18:35.480
going to take all kinds of effort

00:18:36.490 00:18:38.700
whereas if you simply leaned forward and

00:18:39.550 00:18:41.760
got your head and shoulders out in front

00:18:41.890 00:18:44.670
of your feet you would find that you

00:18:44.980 00:18:46.560
reach this balance point and all the

00:18:46.810 00:18:48.750
sudden standing up seems perfectly

00:18:50.730 00:18:54.560
simple another strategy is organization

00:18:55.570 00:18:58.370
have all of your supplies that you need

00:18:59.380 00:19:02.370
in one place activity centers are a good

00:19:02.500 00:19:07.430
way to do this it saves a lot of steps

00:19:08.440 00:19:10.560
it saves a lot of energy we keep talking

00:19:10.960 00:19:12.510
about energy conservation and I could

00:19:12.760 00:19:15.139
probably do a whole talk just on that

00:19:15.599 00:19:17.359
but these are all parts of energy

00:19:18.589 00:19:20.299
conservation having a predictable

00:19:20.820 00:19:24.499
routine is important too just like with

00:19:25.379 00:19:27.320
organizing it saves you a lot of energy

00:19:27.629 00:19:30.169
if you know what's coming if it's the

00:19:30.509 00:19:32.329
same thing that you do in the same way

00:19:33.149 00:19:35.719
every day you know where things are you

00:19:35.999 00:19:37.609
know your moves you can even practice

00:19:38.159 00:19:39.649
those moves and make sure that you're

00:19:39.960 00:19:44.119
really good at doing the the different

00:19:44.549 00:19:45.829
steps or getting the foot placement

00:19:46.440 00:19:49.669
right to say make your pot of oatmeal in

00:19:49.979 00:19:54.909
the morning or make your pot of coffee

00:19:55.919 00:19:57.950
another strategy is to avoid time

00:19:58.639 00:20:00.469
pressures these can come in a lot of

00:20:00.989 00:20:02.959
different forms but certainly don't want

00:20:03.029 00:20:04.609
to try to do something that's hard for

00:20:04.859 00:20:08.359
you to do when you feel like the clock

00:20:08.609 00:20:11.389
is ticking or even worse if your spouse

00:20:11.460 00:20:14.719
is out in the car and they've got the

00:20:14.940 00:20:16.849
car running and you just know that the

00:20:17.159 00:20:19.579
pressure is on you got to hurry up hurry

00:20:19.889 00:20:22.459
and usually takes your focus off of what

00:20:22.710 00:20:26.180
you're doing where it needs to be and on

00:20:26.549 00:20:28.549
to either the clock or the person is

00:20:28.950 00:20:30.469
waiting for you neither of which is

00:20:32.149 00:20:34.369
helpful you might also want to think

00:20:34.589 00:20:38.690
about avoiding timed situations that can

00:20:39.330 00:20:41.599
increase your overall anxiety some

00:20:42.210 00:20:45.219
examples of these would be crosswalks

00:20:46.229 00:20:47.779
you know that you only have so much time

00:20:47.849 00:20:49.700
to get across and some are quicker than

00:20:50.070 00:20:53.299
others so you might find that certain

00:20:53.700 00:20:55.519
ones are going to be too anxiety

00:20:56.269 00:20:58.539
provoking other things that are really

00:20:59.549 00:21:01.399
difficult for people who have freezing

00:21:01.710 00:21:04.639
of gait would be things like escalators

00:21:05.570 00:21:08.209
or the worst ones of all are those

00:21:08.669 00:21:10.849
revolving doors that you see in some

00:21:13.249 00:21:15.829
hotels so if you do have something

00:21:16.169 00:21:19.430
that's important for you to do but maybe

00:21:19.649 00:21:20.100
it's a little bit

00:21:20.650 00:21:23.610
difficult try to plan those things along

00:21:23.830 00:21:26.600
with your exercise during your on times

00:21:27.610 00:21:29.039
that's when your meds are working out

00:21:29.230 00:21:32.070
their best and another way that you

00:21:32.170 00:21:35.070
might want to improve your method of

00:21:35.260 00:21:37.230
doing things or improve your success is

00:21:37.900 00:21:39.720
to throw a piece of adaptive equipment

00:21:40.270 00:21:42.810
at it these come in small forms and big

00:21:43.240 00:21:45.090
forms an example of something really

00:21:45.429 00:21:47.880
small might be a button hook to make it

00:21:48.370 00:21:51.200
easier for you to button with with less

00:21:52.650 00:21:56.070
tediousness less fine motor movements

00:21:56.580 00:22:00.210
required you simply push hold on to the

00:22:00.400 00:22:03.390
hook it push it through the hole you

00:22:03.490 00:22:05.010
know hook the button and you pull it

00:22:05.049 00:22:07.820
back through so none of this required

00:22:08.830 00:22:10.289
you can also use a piece of rubber

00:22:11.370 00:22:14.280
matting cut it into a length roll it

00:22:14.410 00:22:15.990
around a pencil and you've got a nice

00:22:16.450 00:22:18.419
pencil grip same thing could work for

00:22:18.549 00:22:22.560
your toothbrush or an eating utensil to

00:22:22.750 00:22:24.240
give you a little bit better grip and a

00:22:24.460 00:22:27.210
bigger handle so it takes less strength

00:22:27.490 00:22:29.850
and effort and concentration to hold on

00:22:30.070 00:22:33.390
to it a big piece of equipment the

00:22:33.880 00:22:35.280
equipment would be something like I use

00:22:35.559 00:22:40.380
that Walker that's a big Walker that has

00:22:41.230 00:22:43.409
it's in a new shape and it has a laser

00:22:43.809 00:22:46.740
beam that runs across the floor so that

00:22:47.530 00:22:49.620
you've always got a target for your feet

00:22:49.660 00:22:51.600
and that can be very effective for some

00:22:51.940 00:22:56.430
people have freezing of gait so the

00:22:56.710 00:22:58.380
third thing that we that we look at the

00:22:58.570 00:23:02.970
third factor is environment when you're

00:23:03.250 00:23:04.710
looking at changes to the environment

00:23:04.929 00:23:06.360
you want to focus on a number of things

00:23:06.970 00:23:08.909
first your environment should be safe

00:23:09.900 00:23:12.690
you might look at any slipping or

00:23:13.120 00:23:15.960
tripping hazards and they come in all

00:23:16.570 00:23:20.450
forms it could be a little snag in a rug

00:23:21.460 00:23:23.700
it could be a cord across the pathway it

00:23:24.280 00:23:27.299
could be a pet that likes to park itself

00:23:27.610 00:23:29.300
in front of you

00:23:30.310 00:23:32.760
you want to address barriers in your

00:23:33.040 00:23:35.190
home things that keep you from doing

00:23:35.530 00:23:39.030
what you need to do for example a lot of

00:23:39.160 00:23:42.890
people are intimidated by a tub/shower

00:23:43.900 00:23:48.090
because it doesn't feel real safe to get

00:23:48.310 00:23:50.220
their foot up and over and into the tub

00:23:50.800 00:23:53.760
in that case maybe again some adaptive

00:23:53.890 00:23:55.440
equipment could help you could put some

00:23:55.720 00:23:58.920
grab bars in maybe a tub transfer bench

00:23:59.170 00:24:00.540
so that you could sit down and slide

00:24:00.790 00:24:03.600
across to be inside your tub and often

00:24:03.850 00:24:08.250
people find that the tub shower that we

00:24:08.680 00:24:10.770
adapt is even better than the stall

00:24:11.200 00:24:13.110
shower that they thought would be the

00:24:13.510 00:24:17.430
best fit in your environment you also

00:24:17.830 00:24:19.650
want to eliminate distractions and they

00:24:19.930 00:24:21.870
come in all forms as well could be

00:24:22.510 00:24:25.860
auditory distractions visual just too

00:24:26.080 00:24:28.650
much stuff around you when you're trying

00:24:28.810 00:24:33.600
to focus in on what you're doing you do

00:24:33.940 00:24:37.230
want to have cues if they're helpful

00:24:37.930 00:24:40.230
these can come in the form of visual

00:24:40.780 00:24:43.440
cues like pieces of tape on the floor to

00:24:43.630 00:24:46.740
mark where your feet will go auditory

00:24:47.290 00:24:50.370
cues can be helpful too and I'll get

00:24:50.650 00:24:53.670
into that when we talk about how your

00:24:54.040 00:24:58.140
care partners can assist you you want to

00:24:58.420 00:25:00.750
have as we mentioned before activity

00:25:01.330 00:25:03.780
centers that are set up to perform your

00:25:04.060 00:25:05.940
tasks as efficiently as possible a

00:25:06.730 00:25:08.970
really simple example of this is when

00:25:09.220 00:25:10.500
you're in your bathroom at the sink

00:25:11.440 00:25:13.440
where is your hand towel is it behind

00:25:13.960 00:25:16.350
you so that you have to make a turn if

00:25:16.480 00:25:18.270
you have freezing of gait and your feet

00:25:18.490 00:25:20.100
don't want to easily turn or you don't

00:25:20.440 00:25:22.290
shift your weight quickly enough to make

00:25:22.600 00:25:25.920
that pivot turn every time you try to

00:25:26.260 00:25:29.820
turn around to reach that towel you're

00:25:30.130 00:25:31.740
putting yourself at an increased risk

00:25:31.900 00:25:35.670
for a fall simple solution even if you

00:25:35.920 00:25:37.560
don't have a holder for your towel this

00:25:38.190 00:25:40.400
put the towel on the counter in front of

00:25:42.320 00:25:44.299
you another thing you want to look for

00:25:44.490 00:25:47.870
in your environment is whether there are

00:25:48.210 00:25:51.919
lots of crowds noise or confusion and

00:25:52.770 00:25:54.770
you probably have a lot more control of

00:25:54.990 00:25:56.510
your home environment than you do when

00:25:56.640 00:25:59.120
you go out but you do have some control

00:25:59.340 00:26:02.210
when you go out say grocery shopping if

00:26:02.520 00:26:05.419
you go on a Saturday mid to late morning

00:26:05.910 00:26:07.280
you know you're going to have a lot of

00:26:07.770 00:26:09.560
working people who are trying to get in

00:26:09.750 00:26:10.690
and out quickly

00:26:11.700 00:26:14.320
whereas if you were to go on a Thursday

00:26:15.330 00:26:17.360
morning you might find that there are

00:26:17.549 00:26:20.659
not as many crowds you can get through

00:26:20.820 00:26:22.370
the lines quicker you don't have people

00:26:22.740 00:26:24.830
waiting for you to reach into your

00:26:25.350 00:26:26.470
pocket or sign your check

00:26:27.480 00:26:30.590
so the fourth factor that influences

00:26:31.169 00:26:33.500
your function is the amount and type of

00:26:34.200 00:26:36.650
assistance that's needed occupational

00:26:37.640 00:26:40.549
therapists do a lot of training of care

00:26:41.040 00:26:43.310
partners or paid assistants who are

00:26:43.500 00:26:46.549
there to help you and some of the things

00:26:46.919 00:26:49.070
that we like to emphasize that they

00:26:49.290 00:26:53.270
might try doing is to are to notice

00:26:54.030 00:26:58.280
positive changes to practice using

00:26:58.890 00:27:00.890
proper body mechanics themselves so that

00:27:01.200 00:27:03.440
they don't injure themselves and trying

00:27:03.720 00:27:07.419
to take care of you to be able to

00:27:08.429 00:27:11.480
effectively cue and communicate with you

00:27:13.970 00:27:16.340
and regarding this I would say that the

00:27:16.679 00:27:18.500
fewer words the better when you're

00:27:18.750 00:27:22.250
trying to cue somebody one word the word

00:27:22.760 00:27:26.299
big the word power is so much more

00:27:26.760 00:27:27.600
effective than

00:27:27.940 00:27:30.870
to explain why or how you should be

00:27:31.299 00:27:33.630
moving your feet that's confusing that's

00:27:34.000 00:27:37.530
too much information a demonstration

00:27:38.170 00:27:40.350
might be more effective than any verbal

00:27:40.690 00:27:42.539
cue so you have to kind of find out

00:27:42.850 00:27:46.710
what's right for you you want to figure

00:27:46.900 00:27:48.930
out what the easiest safest and most

00:27:49.840 00:27:52.500
efficient way possible is for you as a

00:27:55.380 00:27:57.680
caregiver it's really important that you

00:27:58.690 00:28:01.140
take the time to understand and learn

00:28:01.559 00:28:03.720
about the motor and the non-motor

00:28:03.820 00:28:06.210
symptoms of Parkinson's that can go a

00:28:06.640 00:28:10.230
long way towards understanding why your

00:28:11.190 00:28:16.740
partner does what they do you want to

00:28:16.929 00:28:19.289
know how to use any pieces of adaptive

00:28:20.010 00:28:22.940
equipment that we've placed in the home

00:28:23.950 00:28:25.320
so that you can be safe

00:28:25.929 00:28:27.120
pieces of equipment can be quite

00:28:27.370 00:28:29.039
dangerous if you don't know how to use

00:28:29.290 00:28:31.110
them a perfect example is someone who

00:28:31.330 00:28:34.200
doesn't lock the brakes on their 4-wheel

00:28:34.570 00:28:36.299
walker and then turns around to sit down

00:28:36.640 00:28:38.159
and the walker slides out from under

00:28:38.350 00:28:40.890
them and you want to be able to

00:28:41.530 00:28:43.590
anticipate problems before they occur

00:28:44.470 00:28:46.110
so if you know the tendencies of the

00:28:46.600 00:28:48.990
person that you're working with then you

00:28:49.179 00:28:51.570
might know as you go around and look at

00:28:51.760 00:28:53.130
where they spend their time that that

00:28:53.590 00:28:56.220
office chair on rollers might not be the

00:28:56.470 00:28:58.350
safest thing for them because they tend

00:28:58.480 00:29:02.010
to do airplane landings and that chair

00:29:02.320 00:29:03.750
could slide right out from under them

00:29:04.200 00:29:08.130
and cause a fall so another thing about

00:29:08.980 00:29:10.409
caregiving that's important is knowing

00:29:11.410 00:29:14.280
when to help you want to help when it's

00:29:14.830 00:29:18.000
important to ensure safety you want to

00:29:18.250 00:29:22.590
help when it reinforces new learning to

00:29:22.990 00:29:25.530
prevent unnecessary frustration or

00:29:26.520 00:29:29.310
fatigue so you may even have a closet

00:29:29.440 00:29:31.680
that's full of clothes where you have

00:29:31.929 00:29:32.430
one set of

00:29:32.650 00:29:35.790
shirts that are independent all the time

00:29:36.280 00:29:37.920
you may have another set of shirts that

00:29:39.240 00:29:41.610
you need help with if you're in a hurry

00:29:41.770 00:29:43.560
but otherwise the person can do it

00:29:43.720 00:29:45.600
themselves and they should then you

00:29:45.760 00:29:48.390
might have another set of shirts they

00:29:48.610 00:29:50.070
have lots of buttons maybe they're a

00:29:50.170 00:29:52.410
little bit tighter fitting a little bit

00:29:52.930 00:29:55.440
fuzzier and you like them for a certain

00:29:55.900 00:29:57.360
occasion so those are the ones that

00:29:57.550 00:30:01.520
you're going to help with all the time

00:30:02.530 00:30:05.190
you want to help when it's to encourage

00:30:05.410 00:30:08.720
a person to use their best effort or

00:30:09.730 00:30:12.630
their best amplitude or bigness of

00:30:13.570 00:30:16.100
movement and again a simple word like

00:30:17.160 00:30:21.470
big can be the best thing that you say

00:30:22.480 00:30:25.980
and you want to give wanted feedback at

00:30:26.440 00:30:31.520
the wanted times so you might be

00:30:32.530 00:30:34.140
perfectly free to give feedback when

00:30:34.300 00:30:35.790
you're in your own home in your own

00:30:36.220 00:30:38.550
setting and your partner is very

00:30:39.220 00:30:41.750
comfortable with that but it might feel

00:30:42.760 00:30:44.340
embarrassing to them if you're giving

00:30:44.470 00:30:46.050
them feedback when they're out in public

00:30:46.530 00:30:50.700
or in a social setting so in conclusion

00:30:51.400 00:30:55.170
I hope that you've found this sampler

00:30:55.480 00:30:58.230
platter of strategies helpful I hope

00:30:58.630 00:31:00.990
that you can also partner with an

00:31:01.480 00:31:03.960
occupational therapist or a team of

00:31:04.660 00:31:06.570
therapists that can address your very

00:31:07.000 00:31:10.740
specific and unique needs take care of

00:31:11.110 00:31:16.500
yourselves and stay active
