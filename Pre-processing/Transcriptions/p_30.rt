00:00:04.980 00:00:13.129
Sonia Mathur now we have to go back

00:00:13.440 00:00:17.180
quite a few years take you back why me

00:00:17.820 00:00:20.390
more than 20 years ago um I first

00:00:20.730 00:00:21.770
noticed a tremor in my right pinky

00:00:22.260 00:00:24.170
finger and it was really intermittent

00:00:24.570 00:00:25.640
just kind of more annoying than anything

00:00:26.070 00:00:28.540
else at that time I had just finished my

00:00:29.550 00:00:30.980
training and family medicine at Dunn

00:00:31.350 00:00:33.049
Medical School and residency and family

00:00:33.270 00:00:35.959
practice and actually was expecting my

00:00:35.999 00:00:38.680
first child when the tremor started and

00:00:39.690 00:00:42.139
I was sort of much too busy to sort of

00:00:42.989 00:00:44.899
deal with it at that time and as I said

00:00:45.059 00:00:47.540
it was intermittent but with time and as

00:00:47.850 00:00:50.059
as my pregnancy progressed the tremor

00:00:50.429 00:00:52.189
became more consistent and persistent to

00:00:52.289 00:00:54.169
the point where my husband kind of said

00:00:54.329 00:00:55.340
you know what you've got to go get this

00:00:55.409 00:00:57.649
checked out stop ignoring it and I was

00:00:58.050 00:00:59.059
ignoring it you know like all the

00:00:59.940 00:01:02.329
doctors do their internal symptoms okay

00:01:02.670 00:01:06.170
and I went to see a neurologist in the

00:01:06.330 00:01:08.630
same clinic that I had joined and he

00:01:08.820 00:01:09.980
just put me through the you know the

00:01:10.170 00:01:11.120
clinical testing that we're all put

00:01:11.340 00:01:13.249
through with the quacking and and

00:01:13.829 00:01:17.179
walking the rest of it and he said to me

00:01:17.219 00:01:18.590
I think you have young onset Parkinson's

00:01:18.930 00:01:23.270
disease and I was floored and angry at

00:01:23.490 00:01:25.160
that time and I said and you're

00:01:25.729 00:01:27.889
obviously not very good neurologists and

00:01:28.880 00:01:33.550
I I reject your diagnosis I did X his

00:01:34.560 00:01:36.260
his offered to send me to probably the

00:01:36.719 00:01:38.450
foremost movement disorder specialist in

00:01:38.549 00:01:41.300
the country and and when I went to him

00:01:41.640 00:01:43.130
instead of exonerating from diagnosis

00:01:43.289 00:01:45.349
and confirmed X so young onset

00:01:45.869 00:01:52.069
Parkinson's disease at 27 so they they

00:01:52.350 00:01:54.230
often say that pregnancy kind of

00:01:54.840 00:01:56.599
exacerbate or sometimes it's some weird

00:01:56.939 00:01:58.340
case he's actually make purposes in

00:01:58.490 00:02:00.410
terms better do you think it was

00:02:00.780 00:02:02.630
something that was sort of lying there

00:02:06.350 00:02:09.380
than it's possible I mean if I if I look

00:02:09.600 00:02:11.660
back I was experiencing a little bit of

00:02:11.730 00:02:14.360
the tremor prior to my pregnancy but

00:02:15.239 00:02:16.070
also at that time

00:02:16.410 00:02:18.260
before I got pregnant I had some brain

00:02:18.720 00:02:20.800
surgery done because I had a a benign

00:02:21.810 00:02:23.660
pituitary tumor that was removed so I

00:02:24.150 00:02:25.730
thought it was secondary to the neuro

00:02:26.270 00:02:27.830
surgery so when I went to the

00:02:28.500 00:02:29.870
neurosurgeon and I mentioned that I had

00:02:30.270 00:02:31.610
you know started with a little tremor

00:02:32.430 00:02:33.950
now and again he said oh don't worry

00:02:34.260 00:02:35.960
about your team 40 anything important

00:02:36.930 00:02:39.020
so it actually proceeded whether or not

00:02:39.330 00:02:40.940
it you know the pregnancy exam so they

00:02:41.100 00:02:43.060
did I'm not sure I've had three children

00:02:44.070 00:02:47.690
since then and I think with each of the

00:02:48.600 00:02:49.820
pregnancies it seems to accelerate a

00:02:50.130 00:03:19.479
little bit but then I'm sure there's a

00:03:20.489 00:03:23.870
good question um I think initially it

00:03:24.239 00:03:26.570
hindered me a little bit because I kind

00:03:28.400 00:03:30.979
of you know whatever knowledge I had was

00:03:31.650 00:03:33.830
was probably blown up in my mind in

00:03:33.930 00:03:35.180
terms of what my future would hold so I

00:03:35.930 00:03:37.790
was too much knowledge it's not a good

00:03:37.980 00:03:40.610
thing in that way um because I I could

00:03:40.920 00:03:42.710
sort of you know jump to conclusions and

00:03:43.200 00:03:44.990
in terms of what my future would be um

00:03:45.870 00:03:48.550
but overall I think it has been a help

00:03:49.560 00:03:52.310
simply because i can sort of tell what

00:03:52.440 00:03:54.199
my symptoms are versus my side effects

00:03:54.330 00:04:00.020
from my medications i'm able to sort of

00:04:00.420 00:04:01.850
judge my medications a little bit better

00:04:02.280 00:04:04.600
just having that medical background and

00:04:05.610 00:04:08.570
you know because as you know parkinson's

00:04:08.610 00:04:10.130
disease the symptoms are so pervasive

00:04:10.560 00:04:12.680
they affect every bodily system that we

00:04:12.930 00:04:14.810
have and there are so many other

00:04:15.150 00:04:16.690
diseases that do affect those or

00:04:17.700 00:04:18.560
problems that affect those systems as

00:04:18.690 00:04:20.360
well so to to sort of tease out with

00:04:20.519 00:04:22.670
your parkinson's versus another medical

00:04:23.160 00:04:24.230
situation is sometimes difficult but

00:04:24.750 00:04:27.830
I've been um I guess I know I'll just

00:04:28.140 00:04:29.030
help me Ingrid

00:04:29.580 00:04:30.800
discerning the difference between those

00:04:30.870 00:04:38.720
two and also managing my medications

00:04:39.540 00:04:41.270
yeah I was diagnosed at the beginning of

00:04:41.400 00:04:44.300
my medical career and I practice / I

00:04:44.790 00:04:49.100
could 12 13 years before I had to to

00:04:49.920 00:04:53.870
stop and it was simply because I was

00:04:54.300 00:04:55.940
driving myself into the ground I mean to

00:04:56.370 00:04:57.920
practice medicine I had to sort of tie

00:04:57.990 00:04:59.480
my medications and increase my

00:05:00.090 00:05:02.120
medications in order to be able to give

00:05:02.310 00:05:03.980
back the nation's or to do physical

00:05:04.320 00:05:07.460
exams and that sort of thing but I was

00:05:07.800 00:05:09.140
suffering the side effects of medication

00:05:09.590 00:05:12.230
so I'm talking that I wasn't sleeping um

00:05:12.900 00:05:16.400
you know I was I was anxious I was

00:05:17.250 00:05:18.410
hiding it all the time - that was the

00:05:18.510 00:05:20.570
other thing I hadn't disclosed to my

00:05:21.120 00:05:22.910
patients or my colleagues that I was

00:05:23.490 00:05:25.130
dealing with elements of Parkinson's so

00:05:25.860 00:05:28.940
it was very difficult to hide it in - to

00:05:29.250 00:05:33.020
practice in a way that I felt was um was

00:05:33.180 00:05:35.270
good for my patients and I was basically

00:05:36.030 00:05:36.980
compromising myself so when I went to my

00:05:37.370 00:05:38.780
neurologist towards the end of my career

00:05:39.300 00:05:41.510
she said well you have an option you can

00:05:41.780 00:05:44.270
either walk in your office or you can

00:05:44.550 00:05:46.340
crawl up and your competitors crawling

00:05:46.470 00:05:48.200
up because you know you're just not

00:05:48.540 00:05:50.270
doing yourself any good so those are

00:05:50.310 00:05:51.800
very hard decisions but it was a

00:05:52.050 00:06:01.640
decision I had to me yeah yeah yeah it

00:06:02.660 00:06:05.510
was it was very interesting to be on the

00:06:05.640 00:06:09.400
other side of the examining table but I

00:06:10.410 00:06:12.650
think overall though that the

00:06:13.470 00:06:15.980
Parkinson's experience gave me a lot of

00:06:16.830 00:06:18.620
empathy for my patients in general in

00:06:18.810 00:06:19.700
terms of what they're going through any

00:06:19.920 00:06:21.170
kind of chronic illness or any kind of

00:06:21.720 00:06:23.330
even acute disease because I understood

00:06:23.670 00:06:24.890
where they were I understood how it

00:06:25.560 00:06:27.260
pacted their life and affected their

00:06:27.630 00:06:27.890
quality of life

00:06:28.170 00:06:30.410
and I understood from a very early stage

00:06:30.450 00:06:32.540
in my career that it wasn't the symptoms

00:06:32.670 00:06:33.920
I was treating was the patient that I

00:06:34.080 00:06:35.240
was treating and how they functioned

00:06:35.550 00:06:37.670
overall within their sort of paradigm

00:06:37.830 00:06:39.920
and in terms of their life that was what

00:06:40.050 00:06:42.090
was most important

00:06:42.490 00:06:43.770
Takas this is kind of weird in the fact

00:06:43.930 00:06:45.540
that it takes away a lot but it gives a

00:06:45.700 00:06:47.700
lot as well that might be kind of one of

00:06:47.920 00:06:49.880
the things it perhaps gave you you know

00:06:50.890 00:06:53.610
absolutely I agree huh I think Michael J

00:06:53.650 00:07:01.500
Fox doesn't get the keeps on taking what

00:07:01.690 00:07:03.210
would you say your proudest of since

00:07:03.340 00:07:11.060
your diagnosis that you've achieved or I

00:07:12.070 00:07:16.680
I mean to be honest I think what I'm

00:07:16.720 00:07:18.630
most proudest of it and this goes for

00:07:18.880 00:07:20.160
any parent I think I'm most proud of my

00:07:20.380 00:07:22.440
children but in terms of the Parkinson's

00:07:22.600 00:07:25.620
I guess I'm most proud of how we as a

00:07:25.930 00:07:27.240
family have been able to weather through

00:07:27.510 00:07:30.480
this and are continuing to deal deal

00:07:30.730 00:07:33.180
with this I think that it has the

00:07:33.580 00:07:35.760
potential to really cause a lot of

00:07:36.070 00:07:37.970
stress and strain in family structure

00:07:38.980 00:07:41.100
but with our kids we've sort of been

00:07:42.690 00:07:45.360
very proactive in terms of how we

00:07:45.880 00:07:47.370
explain the situation and how we deal

00:07:47.410 00:07:49.560
with it and because that's all they've

00:07:49.600 00:07:50.760
known they've only no need to have

00:07:51.310 00:07:52.260
Parkinson's disease so for them is quite

00:07:52.660 00:07:54.870
normal but it's talking a lot of empathy

00:07:55.090 00:07:56.940
and compassion and and the importance of

00:07:57.400 00:07:59.790
charity evening and I think that's one

00:07:59.830 00:08:12.930
of those plans yeah - there was this one

00:08:13.090 00:08:14.930
was the first one my grandpa she and

00:08:15.940 00:08:18.930
that was more like a preschool book just

00:08:19.210 00:08:22.350
a way for it's about a grandfather and

00:08:22.450 00:08:24.450
his grandson and how despite the

00:08:25.150 00:08:26.610
grandfather's you know shakiness the

00:08:27.040 00:08:28.860
grandson only sees his grandfather for

00:08:28.990 00:08:31.410
who he is it's someone he loves very

00:08:31.630 00:08:33.540
much and so that's kind of just a little

00:08:34.510 00:08:36.209
storybook but then I wrote this one with

00:08:36.400 00:08:38.820
my daughter's um shake hands a kid's

00:08:39.760 00:08:42.089
she was Parkinson's disease and that was

00:08:42.300 00:08:45.450
very therapeutic for us um you know my

00:08:45.760 00:08:46.800
daughter's all contributed to the book

00:08:47.050 00:08:48.060
and that the process was really

00:08:49.060 00:08:51.000
important because I that's one thing is

00:08:51.400 00:08:53.579
that you know children are affected by

00:08:53.650 00:08:55.380
this disease I mean our family units

00:08:55.720 00:08:56.790
practice by this disease it's not just

00:08:56.920 00:08:58.770
us that receive diagnosis and that day

00:09:00.060 00:09:02.280
and our children are very vulnerable and

00:09:02.410 00:09:04.650
they and they often make up stories in

00:09:04.870 00:09:05.820
their minds that are worse than the

00:09:06.070 00:09:08.280
truth itself so I think it's important

00:09:08.500 00:09:13.470
for us as as adults to sort of guide

00:09:13.750 00:09:15.240
them through the process because it can

00:09:15.490 00:09:16.860
be scary for them to see changes in

00:09:17.050 00:09:18.600
their loved ones but they don't know

00:09:18.850 00:09:34.980
what how to explain it how how they're

00:09:35.290 00:09:37.710
involved in the kind of process of

00:09:38.440 00:09:39.840
living with Parkinson's and I think it's

00:09:40.420 00:09:42.060
it's a really important question like

00:09:42.250 00:09:49.620
how you how you tell your family that's

00:09:49.840 00:09:51.450
right yeah I think that children are

00:09:51.610 00:09:53.760
very intuitive so even if you don't tell

00:09:54.010 00:09:55.530
them they know they know something's

00:09:55.750 00:09:58.200
going and like I said what they feel

00:09:58.720 00:10:00.000
might be going on it's probably worse

00:10:00.040 00:10:02.820
than what is actually going on so being

00:10:02.950 00:10:04.710
able to be open with them and give them

00:10:04.830 00:10:06.690
a create an environment they feel

00:10:06.850 00:10:08.280
comfortable to ask questions cuz this

00:10:09.010 00:10:10.110
disease as you know is progressive it

00:10:10.510 00:10:11.580
changes with time so they should always

00:10:12.010 00:10:13.650
feel that they're able to ask questions

00:10:14.110 00:10:17.310
about without you know any reprimanding

00:10:17.440 00:10:18.600
or anything like that or feeling

00:10:18.700 00:10:20.760
embarrassed or unable to do so so I

00:10:21.070 00:10:22.770
think that conversation in creating that

00:10:23.080 00:10:25.350
open environment and for discussion is

00:10:25.540 00:10:28.710
really important it helps them cope and

00:10:35.190 00:10:37.260
empower say on the train or something

00:10:37.450 00:10:44.300
you know there's a mother with the child

00:10:45.310 00:10:55.260
the moms usually get quite just hold

00:10:55.480 00:10:56.850
what they try and explain as best I can

00:10:57.160 00:11:06.660
because I think the future absolutely

00:11:07.030 00:11:09.180
and they learn that you know

00:11:09.370 00:11:10.800
life isn't always like it's gonna

00:11:11.020 00:11:13.440
present challenges and and you know it's

00:11:13.720 00:11:15.510
away faces challenge that's most

00:11:16.090 00:11:24.090
important so yeah I think very sort of

00:11:35.250 00:11:40.410
poise I think I think you might be

00:11:40.720 00:11:46.670
mistaken but together that's for sure

00:11:47.680 00:11:51.170
you know I think part of it is that I

00:11:52.180 00:11:53.910
don't I mean Parkinson's is definitely

00:11:54.130 00:11:55.800
part of my life and it's a big part of

00:11:55.930 00:11:57.900
my life you know it affects you

00:11:58.300 00:11:59.960
physically mentally emotionally socially

00:12:00.970 00:12:02.250
but it's not me

00:12:02.320 00:12:04.530
I've never defined it myself but as

00:12:05.550 00:12:08.250
Parkinson's I'm a mother I'm a wife I'm

00:12:08.350 00:12:10.710
a friend and a daughter and sort of

00:12:11.380 00:12:12.300
concentrating on those roles and

00:12:13.000 00:12:15.360
concentrating on how best to be those

00:12:15.730 00:12:20.040
roles is more important to me so maybe

00:12:20.290 00:12:21.330
that has something to do with it I also

00:12:21.850 00:12:23.280
do know that self-care is really

00:12:23.770 00:12:26.100
important so I do try and it's even more

00:12:26.560 00:12:27.600
important when you have something like

00:12:28.180 00:12:30.420
Parkinson's so I do try and you know eat

00:12:30.730 00:12:32.640
well and exercise and things like that

00:12:32.830 00:12:34.710
keep active and keep my mind active it's

00:12:34.900 00:12:37.500
really important being engaged in the

00:13:00.730 00:13:04.260
so much I think the thing I would say to

00:13:04.390 00:13:06.990
them is that you know what you have to

00:13:07.150 00:13:08.820
come to a place of acceptance I mean

00:13:09.160 00:13:10.800
this diagnosis really is not within our

00:13:11.110 00:13:12.900
control we didn't ask for this diagnosis

00:13:13.630 00:13:15.120
but how we face the challenges that this

00:13:15.610 00:13:16.740
diagnosis brings into our life is really

00:13:16.930 00:13:19.920
ours to determine and we have to you

00:13:19.960 00:13:22.309
know make ourselves

00:13:23.319 00:13:26.009
stronger in terms of how we approach the

00:13:26.769 00:13:28.619
Parkinson's disease because we are we

00:13:28.809 00:13:30.090
have to be active participants in our

00:13:30.279 00:13:32.790
own management we can't depend on the

00:13:33.160 00:13:34.739
medical system to treat us without us

00:13:35.439 00:13:36.749
participating as well so that means

00:13:37.059 00:13:38.999
building your team of people that help

00:13:39.189 00:13:41.610
you out you know reach out to people in

00:13:41.860 00:13:44.189
terms of support friends family online

00:13:44.379 00:13:45.660
support groups other people in the

00:13:46.480 00:13:48.749
Parkinson's community make sure that you

00:13:49.389 00:13:50.460
control those variables that you do have

00:13:50.620 00:13:51.720
control over like your diet and your

00:13:52.329 00:13:53.759
exercising your activity don't isolate

00:13:54.040 00:13:55.679
yourself that's that's another thing

00:13:55.870 00:13:58.829
that a lot of patients tend to do it's

00:13:59.079 00:14:01.230
not worth it it's it's really isn't

00:14:01.360 00:14:03.030
there's a whole community of really

00:14:03.550 00:14:04.860
supportive people that are there for you

00:14:05.259 00:14:10.889
should you choose to access them what

00:14:11.079 00:14:15.860
else could I say make sure that you you

00:14:16.870 00:14:17.970
educate yourself that's another really

00:14:18.339 00:14:19.170
important thing especially early on

00:14:19.839 00:14:21.239
disease educate yourself about the

00:14:21.879 00:14:22.860
symptoms about the side consume

00:14:23.410 00:14:25.650
medications how your medications work be

00:14:26.319 00:14:29.189
very very rigid in terms of your routine

00:14:29.279 00:14:31.739
I self-care routines medication routines

00:14:32.670 00:14:34.619
follow-ups just become very active in

00:14:34.720 00:14:35.759
terms of your management your

00:14:36.370 00:14:37.259
participation because really you're the

00:14:37.389 00:14:38.519
one in charge you're the only one that

00:14:38.829 00:14:41.910
knows what your what if the goals are

00:14:42.189 00:14:44.100
and always always always keep your

00:14:44.470 00:14:46.230
quality blank in mind because only you

00:14:46.420 00:14:47.369
can define what your quality of like

00:14:47.559 00:14:49.499
this for some it might be you know

00:14:49.929 00:14:50.850
getting to the point where they can walk

00:14:51.160 00:14:52.590
around the block for others that might

00:14:52.720 00:14:54.269
be running a marathon but only you know

00:14:54.459 00:14:55.739
what it's gonna bring quality of life

00:14:56.019 00:14:58.110
and make sure that you mobilize the

00:14:58.149 00:14:59.999
resources around you in order to to

00:15:00.160 00:15:09.750
reach those two goals
