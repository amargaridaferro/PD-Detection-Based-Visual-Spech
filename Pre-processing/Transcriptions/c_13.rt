00:00:00.989 00:00:04.640
alright TMS may work but it's my Western

00:00:05.210 00:00:07.909
medical professionals way of beginning

00:00:08.400 00:00:11.600
of monopoly on this whole third type of

00:00:11.960 00:00:15.230
therapy all right it's it's just it's

00:00:15.420 00:00:17.960
just a way to make money by focusing on

00:00:18.539 00:00:21.170
TMS and not exactly what's going on I

00:00:21.539 00:00:23.450
was just watching a guy on YouTube

00:00:24.269 00:00:25.820
explain it just he made a month a video

00:00:25.859 00:00:28.790
a month ago and he said yeah we can

00:00:29.340 00:00:31.519
explain where we can't explain how TMS

00:00:31.859 00:00:34.790
works alright for Parkinson's and and

00:00:35.130 00:00:37.430
other than other i would say nerve

00:00:37.950 00:00:40.010
related diseases but they could call it

00:00:40.860 00:00:43.790
neurological but I say it's we're

00:00:44.430 00:00:47.209
focusing on the nerve impulses out of

00:00:47.550 00:00:52.729
out of all of its or yeah and he said

00:00:52.770 00:00:54.889
that he could explain how drugs work

00:00:55.379 00:00:57.560
they've spent a lot of time on aspirin

00:00:57.930 00:01:01.010
and and and the morphine and how that

00:01:01.500 00:01:02.689
works how they work but they can't

00:01:03.619 00:01:09.020
explain the the electrical aspects of

00:01:09.540 00:01:12.859
how TMS works and that's just it it's an

00:01:13.640 00:01:16.100
electrical aspect they can they could

00:01:16.259 00:01:18.590
take pretty good guesses okay but

00:01:19.080 00:01:21.310
without any regular scientific

00:01:22.400 00:01:24.080
experimentation and and there just

00:01:24.270 00:01:26.539
hasn't been enough funding for the set

00:01:27.540 00:01:28.910
experimentation because it's just not

00:01:29.070 00:01:31.280
that profitable if they can't monopolize

00:01:32.009 00:01:34.730
it in TMS I was watching this guy to he

00:01:35.220 00:01:38.030
said that the FDA hasn't approved it but

00:01:38.460 00:01:40.190
what is the FDA Food and Drug

00:01:40.790 00:01:42.649
Administration they don't deal with

00:01:42.960 00:01:45.200
anything else outside of that you know

00:01:45.710 00:01:47.780
why that'd be overstepping their

00:01:48.780 00:01:50.740
boundaries that have to call themselves

00:01:51.750 00:01:55.880
Food Drug and and device food and foot

00:01:56.009 00:01:57.760
in the Vice administration or

00:01:59.180 00:02:01.429
Association their focuses on Food and

00:02:01.680 00:02:03.289
Drug you know you need to get approval

00:02:03.840 00:02:09.979
from somebody else so to to effectively

00:02:10.319 00:02:13.170
get people confidence in this up

00:02:13.390 00:02:17.369
proach for curing Parkinson's yet you

00:02:17.620 00:02:19.740
need you need that kind of you need some

00:02:20.049 00:02:23.399
approval from from from experts in the

00:02:23.739 00:02:25.949
field there's there's there are a lot of

00:02:26.349 00:02:29.339
doctors who are saying good things about

00:02:29.560 00:02:32.190
it but you know the competitor doctors

00:02:32.379 00:02:33.750
are going to say bad things you know to

00:02:34.120 00:02:35.759
stick with the drugs that's your only

00:02:36.120 00:02:38.099
hope although there's there's just so

00:02:38.519 00:02:41.069
much so many problems with drugs it's

00:02:41.920 00:02:43.649
incredible that was that people have

00:02:43.810 00:02:45.569
been sticking with these drugs for so

00:02:46.260 00:02:50.309
long but TMS to me in in carrying these

00:02:50.889 00:02:52.199
neurological diseases which I you know I

00:02:52.269 00:02:53.789
think Hillary Clinton could benefit from

00:02:54.250 00:02:56.940
I think that's one way of approaching it

00:02:57.939 00:03:01.409
it could be it's pretty much another way

00:03:01.450 00:03:03.720
of doing magnet therapy magnet therapy

00:03:04.150 00:03:07.229
is another way of doing acupuncture okay

00:03:07.419 00:03:10.920
because they all affect that energy that

00:03:11.290 00:03:13.110
is coursing through us as I'm speaking

00:03:13.689 00:03:15.659
we're all will have that energy it's

00:03:16.569 00:03:18.390
Chinese called it tooth out the call it

00:03:18.699 00:03:21.479
Chi two thousand years ago all right

00:03:22.060 00:03:23.849
it's it's an energy that can be

00:03:24.729 00:03:26.909
manipulated they found in the soldiers

00:03:27.159 00:03:28.979
phone that and they're getting shot in

00:03:29.169 00:03:31.199
the arrow by shot in the knees by arrows

00:03:31.840 00:03:34.619
that this pain somewhere else in their

00:03:34.810 00:03:36.659
body went away it's all interconnected

00:03:37.620 00:03:40.379
and you can take a good approach with

00:03:41.549 00:03:45.300
the calming and soothing your your

00:03:45.849 00:03:47.879
nerves and and in body parts of

00:03:48.250 00:03:49.979
anything's firing off weird or whatever

00:03:50.709 00:03:52.770
wonky you can cure it with the magnet

00:03:52.930 00:03:55.020
therapy I've been doing it for many many

00:03:55.329 00:03:59.249
years now I don't have Parkinson's but i

00:03:59.439 00:04:00.990
mean that's that's like making the

00:04:01.239 00:04:03.869
argument well there's no Tigers around

00:04:04.120 00:04:05.939
because I'm holding this rock you know

00:04:06.250 00:04:07.439
people are going to make that argument I

00:04:07.629 00:04:09.539
don't agree I mean I have a nervous

00:04:10.180 00:04:11.819
disorder and it was getting worse and

00:04:11.889 00:04:16.020
worse and worse and it just it seemed to

00:04:16.150 00:04:17.969
have turned around overnight when I

00:04:18.130 00:04:20.189
started in with magnet therapy just just

00:04:20.259 00:04:22.320
the basic things just I just got a few

00:04:22.479 00:04:23.969
of these little things at the hardware

00:04:24.450 00:04:26.250
store okay at a craft

00:04:26.560 00:04:29.490
store you can cure your medical problems

00:04:29.860 00:04:32.520
at the craft store so people aren't

00:04:32.680 00:04:34.290
going to give that much credit they'd

00:04:34.330 00:04:36.180
rather go to the doctor's office with

00:04:36.310 00:04:37.890
the guys in the white coat we're putting

00:04:37.990 00:04:40.970
on the stage it's theatrics of health

00:04:41.980 00:04:43.890
okay go on to a craft store to look for

00:04:45.030 00:04:48.240
your new medical solutions go to go to

00:04:48.760 00:04:51.720
an herbal store a natural store to find

00:04:52.060 00:04:55.710
your your your cures for for a disease

00:04:56.140 00:04:58.470
oh no that's that's not putting on the

00:04:58.660 00:05:01.170
right theatrics to to convince people

00:05:01.210 00:05:03.000
that it's working and that's the thing

00:05:03.220 00:05:06.180
with magnet therapy all right and they

00:05:06.310 00:05:09.450
even argued that in TMS it doesn't make

00:05:09.520 00:05:12.330
you from sad to happy it makes you from

00:05:12.640 00:05:14.550
sad to normal and make it there is

00:05:14.860 00:05:16.890
people who suffer from over joy it'll

00:05:17.050 00:05:19.280
make you from over joy to normal it

00:05:20.290 00:05:22.830
normalizes okay it normalizes and

00:05:23.530 00:05:27.800
balances out your nerves all right I've

00:05:28.810 00:05:31.710
gotten like really panicky before magnet

00:05:31.930 00:05:33.600
therapy a lot sand and I would have to

00:05:33.940 00:05:36.600
sit and stand there and just try to calm

00:05:36.760 00:05:38.850
down and it didn't work quite as well

00:05:39.250 00:05:43.080
and then I would after started magnet

00:05:43.300 00:05:47.520
therapy it Mike I felt like I was able

00:05:47.920 00:05:51.150
to calm down better but I did I still

00:05:51.310 00:05:53.310
have kind of my moments but that's just

00:05:53.560 00:05:55.320
where I increase my magnet therapy as

00:05:55.360 00:05:57.930
well and get a better result sometimes

00:05:58.150 00:06:00.720
you have to increase your exposure to it

00:06:00.850 00:06:02.610
and I could call it increase your dosage

00:06:03.040 00:06:04.800
and then also to make it sound like I'm

00:06:05.290 00:06:08.460
talking about fda approval stuff but in

00:06:08.530 00:06:10.110
a way it's kind of increasing your

00:06:11.020 00:06:13.050
dosage but you're not ingesting anything

00:06:13.270 00:06:15.570
nothing is being you know taken in you

00:06:16.060 00:06:18.870
you're just exposing this this powerful

00:06:19.360 00:06:21.240
powerful magnets I don't know if I can

00:06:21.670 00:06:23.790
prove you know this is metal I guess the

00:06:24.400 00:06:28.170
powerful magnet to your body and it's

00:06:28.480 00:06:30.120
it's uh it works with your electrical

00:06:30.700 00:06:32.520
impulses you got to learn more about it

00:06:32.620 00:06:34.590
I mean I think Hillary Clinton if she's

00:06:34.780 00:06:35.910
not doing it she could definitely

00:06:36.820 00:06:38.400
benefit from it if she hasn't done it I

00:06:39.100 00:06:40.170
mean that would be

00:06:40.449 00:06:42.629
the best approach for her to maintain a

00:06:43.090 00:06:46.200
more stable composure all right it's

00:06:46.720 00:06:48.840
it's uh yeah it's it's there's a lot a

00:06:48.940 00:06:50.430
lot of benefit to be head but it's not

00:06:50.860 00:06:52.680
it's not widely accepted by Western

00:06:53.259 00:06:56.340
Western medicine so you got it there's

00:06:56.650 00:06:59.400
there's a lot to how magnets work it's

00:06:59.650 00:07:02.159
it's amazing I mean Earth has natural

00:07:02.560 00:07:03.689
magnets they say you can ground your

00:07:04.000 00:07:05.939
feet in the ground and and get a nice

00:07:06.699 00:07:08.100
magnetin like sand or something to get a

00:07:08.289 00:07:10.830
nice then a little electrical charge to

00:07:11.050 00:07:12.990
help balance you know bring yourself in

00:07:13.210 00:07:16.310
touch with nature again balance yourself

00:07:17.320 00:07:20.310
just the water the water running over

00:07:20.620 00:07:23.070
the electrical earth and in its natural

00:07:23.410 00:07:25.650
state it gets a little charge water gets

00:07:25.750 00:07:28.409
a little charge I keep I keep some

00:07:28.810 00:07:31.170
magnets I keep this magnets in my water

00:07:31.810 00:07:33.810
okay it's just a ceramic magnet and it's

00:07:34.300 00:07:38.580
definitely weaker than the neodymium but

00:07:38.800 00:07:40.770
they both work you get see that's what

00:07:41.289 00:07:44.430
TMI yeah you get more powerful magnetic

00:07:44.470 00:07:47.250
force through electricity they've

00:07:47.560 00:07:49.409
figured out that you can turn on the

00:07:49.960 00:07:51.810
magnetism and turn it off this is

00:07:52.449 00:07:55.230
constantly on this is always on but with

00:07:55.720 00:07:57.480
tioman you turn the magnetism on and off

00:07:58.240 00:08:00.300
that's where it gets costly okay you

00:08:00.400 00:08:03.510
know more more economical approaches

00:08:03.669 00:08:05.430
would be to just get get the neodymium

00:08:06.220 00:08:07.020
even though they're pretty darn

00:08:07.770 00:08:10.320
expensive chip races get jacked up every

00:08:10.780 00:08:13.020
softened by China about this this is a

00:08:13.270 00:08:15.990
good one just having the natural

00:08:16.419 00:08:18.390
exposure to the earth to just being in

00:08:18.550 00:08:20.129
touch with nature that's one great way

00:08:20.169 00:08:22.129
of getting in touch with the magnetism

00:08:23.139 00:08:27.110
city life isn't really that's that

00:08:28.120 00:08:30.180
healthy for us being exposed all that

00:08:30.460 00:08:32.730
plastic and stuff that just neutralizes

00:08:32.979 00:08:35.430
the charge you know I was watching a

00:08:35.829 00:08:37.980
lightning storm last night and I was

00:08:38.050 00:08:39.659
thinking wow you know that that's good

00:08:40.209 00:08:42.000
therapy but it's a little too much okay

00:08:42.579 00:08:44.340
you don't want to overdo the electrical

00:08:44.800 00:08:45.780
therapy because you're controlling

00:08:46.450 00:08:49.740
electrical pulses on and too much will

00:08:49.930 00:08:51.900
get you just like too many drugs I mean

00:08:52.209 00:08:53.790
in there killing people with

00:08:54.010 00:08:56.130
both electricity and drugs i mean it's

00:08:56.769 00:08:58.380
it's all it's a lot in the dosage

00:08:59.050 00:09:01.019
alright to see its medicinal a certain

00:09:01.240 00:09:04.610
amount and it's it's killiow at too much

00:09:05.620 00:09:08.820
alright so if Clinton if Clinton's not

00:09:09.279 00:09:11.550
doing magnet therapy I mean people

00:09:11.730 00:09:13.829
should make the therapist should really

00:09:13.959 00:09:16.259
get on board and talk over with their

00:09:16.660 00:09:17.900
medical professionals about that

00:09:18.910 00:09:20.790
whatever whatever approach is taking

00:09:21.459 00:09:23.699
isn't working very well for so this is

00:09:24.010 00:09:25.590
the way to do it this is a great way to

00:09:25.959 00:09:28.610
promote magnet therapy and get people up

00:09:29.620 00:09:31.710
off of drugs stop the addiction that's

00:09:32.079 00:09:33.269
that's the number one thing stop the

00:09:33.670 00:09:34.920
addiction for all these all these

00:09:35.829 00:09:37.410
over-the-counter under the counter if

00:09:37.660 00:09:39.480
it's sugar is a drug that would be a

00:09:39.760 00:09:42.870
great step towards getting sugar you

00:09:42.970 00:09:45.269
know on the drug list and people off the

00:09:45.820 00:09:47.370
addiction you know get the you know take

00:09:47.890 00:09:49.889
have the the sugar industry take a step

00:09:50.170 00:09:52.110
back you know they've been lying to us

00:09:52.420 00:09:57.030
