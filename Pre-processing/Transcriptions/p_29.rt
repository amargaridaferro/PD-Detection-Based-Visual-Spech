00:00:04.710 00:00:16.099
Zoe Barrett yeah sure not probably it

00:00:16.320 00:00:17.660
was quite easy at him I'm one of the

00:00:17.880 00:00:20.000
lucky ones I think I was diagnosed in

00:00:20.940 00:00:22.160
September 2012 we always have to think

00:00:22.350 00:00:26.720
about that and September 2012 and it was

00:00:26.970 00:00:29.000
about six months before that I noticed

00:00:29.189 00:00:30.950
when making a scrambled egg I was a

00:00:31.260 00:00:32.869
whisking the egg certainly knows what's

00:00:33.000 00:00:34.670
up wit sooner realize oh look my hands

00:00:34.829 00:00:36.650
not stop whisking that's quite thought

00:00:36.780 00:00:39.470
it was quite funny no no what so I'll

00:00:39.630 00:00:40.610
try again and I managed to stop it

00:00:41.010 00:00:41.959
wouldn't think really thinking about it

00:00:42.059 00:00:43.580
I did it again I went that's brilliant

00:00:43.980 00:00:45.319
Donal I thought was amazing so it was a

00:00:45.540 00:00:47.780
great trip and do you think much of it

00:00:48.629 00:00:53.000
yeah thank you just whisk anything but

00:00:53.160 00:00:55.060
then it starts to get quite pains in my

00:00:56.070 00:00:57.889
right shoulder which was the same side

00:00:58.200 00:01:01.819

00:01:05.549 00:01:08.749
concentrate a second mmm okay okay I

00:01:09.329 00:01:10.489
thought was I thought I had a trapped

00:01:10.560 00:01:13.760
nerve Zoo Oh painful it kind of went

00:01:13.979 00:01:16.550
down my arm a little bit but and I found

00:01:16.950 00:01:17.989
certain things my hand was a little bit

00:01:18.329 00:01:19.609
slower couldn't do we know the small

00:01:20.549 00:01:21.830
loss of dexterity basically couldn't

00:01:23.549 00:01:24.919
the keyboard but didn't anything much of

00:01:25.639 00:01:27.529
it anger it worse

00:01:27.619 00:01:30.379
I suddenly realized when I was a coming

00:01:30.509 00:01:31.969

to walk three miles because I can get

00:01:37.169 00:01:39.050
couldn't get bus or taxi home because it

00:01:39.090 00:01:42.289

00:01:46.859 00:01:48.739
leg start to really drag and at that

00:01:48.929 00:01:50.719
point my friends around said to me you

00:01:50.789 00:01:51.469

00:01:51.810 00:01:54.589

00:01:54.749 00:01:56.269
we've the Rowling's must be that tram

00:01:56.459 00:01:58.580
there I've got my shoulder so I went to

00:01:58.679 00:01:59.269
the GP

00:01:59.669 00:02:01.099
cheap pizza around the said I think you

00:02:01.139 00:02:02.359
should see a neurologist went really

00:02:02.789 00:02:04.069
okay look I didn't really think about it

00:02:04.229 00:02:06.279
was really light-hearted about it

00:02:07.289 00:02:08.449
filing on a point where neurologist

00:02:08.910 00:02:10.219
which is in there September where they

00:02:10.440 00:02:11.119
went oh yeah I think you've got

00:02:11.459 00:02:14.539
Parkinson's whoa oh okay I suppose I'm

00:02:14.640 00:02:15.589
just good medication for that and I'll

00:02:15.840 00:02:16.550
fix it no

00:02:16.650 00:02:18.800
and I walked out the room or like cried

00:02:19.290 00:02:21.979
and then went I've got a I've got a name

00:02:22.200 00:02:23.570
- I know what it is now but drugged you

00:02:23.790 00:02:24.920
thought on that really bad shoulder

00:02:25.290 00:02:27.530
there's I'm really painful if absence

00:02:27.690 00:02:29.809
was for me and then I thought should I

00:02:29.940 00:02:32.960
look online no be ok and I start getting

00:02:33.269 00:02:36.080
nervous and worried about everything and

00:02:36.239 00:02:45.199
then that was it that was a bath awesome

00:02:45.720 00:02:47.780
that easy then I think it was a little

00:02:47.940 00:02:49.340
bit blase about it sometimes I kind of

00:02:50.100 00:02:51.590
think maybe should have taken a bit more

00:02:52.140 00:02:54.289
serious and thought about around such

00:02:54.480 00:02:55.820
one medication hell yes I want some

00:03:05.299 00:03:09.020
medication no can't even I think I'm

00:03:09.120 00:03:11.150
gonna stop taking my medication and I

00:03:11.370 00:03:12.740
cannot start looking through stuff on

00:03:12.840 00:03:14.870
the web on websites and no internet I'm

00:03:15.030 00:03:16.490
not really one for and lights of panic

00:03:16.799 00:03:18.589
myself I hope then that why read stuff

00:03:18.750 00:03:20.059
that mine it may never happen to you

00:03:20.310 00:03:21.710
accompany my scanner you know you know

00:03:21.810 00:03:24.199
okay so that's why I'm a bit naive I

00:03:24.810 00:03:27.110
think you know I'm not being I'm not

00:03:27.359 00:03:28.520
hiding away from it I don't know fully

00:03:28.680 00:03:29.930
well you know good idea what's gonna

00:03:30.060 00:03:32.479
happen or not gonna happen or I can't

00:03:32.730 00:03:34.400
accept to take one to one day time back

00:03:34.590 00:03:36.559
and it's a it's a on the start taking

00:03:36.690 00:03:38.420
medication and I realized after a while

00:03:38.819 00:03:41.059
it wasn't working any meter all the

00:03:41.640 00:03:42.800
medication or take a little bit and a

00:03:43.260 00:03:44.900
little bit more or tweak it or change it

00:03:45.090 00:03:46.940
as anyone yeah it's quite serious

00:04:05.150 00:04:20.870
there's gonna be fine yeah yeah where

00:04:20.970 00:04:23.029
you come up people say changing

00:04:23.520 00:04:24.680
medication that's really weird Wow why

00:04:24.930 00:04:26.149
didn't aqui do not sell the stuff

00:04:26.340 00:04:27.830
doesn't work or the side effects from

00:04:27.930 00:04:29.450
the medication I'm taking that too

00:04:29.729 00:04:30.890
let's to stop that from doing that and

00:04:31.289 00:04:32.240
then I have to say that one at that time

00:04:32.639 00:04:34.879
he even is bizarrely you kind of like

00:04:35.130 00:04:37.129
you may understand it from friends and

00:04:37.590 00:04:38.629
family I think they still don't quite

00:04:39.090 00:04:39.409
get it

00:04:39.539 00:04:40.730
you know and I understand because it's

00:04:40.889 00:04:43.070
my bottling thing in the world I think

00:04:43.319 00:04:44.719
that's where the community comes into

00:04:44.940 00:04:53.839
place I have yeah I agree I think that's

00:04:53.940 00:04:55.309
the best thing I think I think that's

00:04:55.560 00:04:56.990
why I mean that when I start going

00:04:57.210 00:04:59.029
online the stuff main thing I wanted to

00:04:59.250 00:05:00.460
do is find people the same age as me

00:05:01.470 00:05:02.900
male/female that didn't really care and

00:05:03.090 00:05:05.050
it was nice also looking for people

00:05:06.060 00:05:07.969
close by or nearby because I thought I

00:05:08.130 00:05:10.850
need to be nice to chat to people people

00:05:10.919 00:05:12.050
who understand you know kind of on the

00:05:12.240 00:05:13.430
same level regardless if they've got

00:05:13.800 00:05:14.870
different symptoms stuff they've all got

00:05:14.970 00:05:16.969
the same well supposedly they're the

00:05:17.130 00:05:20.420
same condition but but we all know we

00:05:20.460 00:05:21.529
have to take medication we all know

00:05:21.720 00:05:23.360
there's no cure we all know we just deal

00:05:23.400 00:05:25.339
with it all of it so I'm signing the

00:05:25.530 00:05:27.140
fine it's quite nice to know even if you

00:05:27.509 00:05:28.730
never act like mean you we've never

00:05:28.949 00:05:30.110
really spoken that much but we sure let

00:05:30.150 00:05:33.189
me know each other already know somebody

00:05:34.199 00:05:37.010
online friend should be on this

00:05:37.259 00:05:49.820
wonderful condition yeah yeah I started

00:05:50.130 00:05:51.499
with the mean David start chatting about

00:05:51.900 00:05:53.450
it McKenna said we need to meet more

00:05:53.520 00:05:55.040
people it must be more people just like

00:05:55.199 00:05:57.170
us who need support and it's real want

00:05:57.630 00:06:00.290
friendship and support you know anything

00:06:00.330 00:06:01.670
like you say like you'll be great to be

00:06:01.740 00:06:03.529
able to chat with somebody - it's your

00:06:03.719 00:06:05.240
a.m. in the morning I'm like messenger

00:06:05.580 00:06:08.450
and Allah so I cell phone a young

00:06:09.120 00:06:10.640
Parkinson's network could just cook

00:06:10.800 00:06:12.020
great someone to student parks network

00:06:12.389 00:06:14.270
and I'm primarily based in their North

00:06:14.460 00:06:16.279
Manchester Barry so that's why we kind

00:06:16.469 00:06:20.180
of meet and speak so it's slow with me

00:06:20.849 00:06:23.959
then once a month and I'm with varies

00:06:24.060 00:06:25.700
between moving to pop obviously so

00:06:25.740 00:06:27.320
that's a good place to start because

00:06:27.570 00:06:28.969
when I hold the focus we're still young

00:06:29.190 00:06:32.260
and hip and cool so I can tell anyway

00:06:33.270 00:06:34.879
Rock Park euro parks I've been shuffling

00:06:35.070 00:06:37.070
in someone needs a Scotties is totally

00:06:37.229 00:06:39.800
because he can't walk so got

00:06:40.810 00:06:42.060
there's a person that were drunk and I

00:06:42.130 00:06:43.920
even have anything to drink yet another

00:06:44.320 00:06:54.470
person just three because he can't speak

00:06:56.010 00:06:58.800
I agree does it help they can I think it

00:06:59.170 00:07:01.230
helped helps you when you're not with

00:07:01.360 00:07:02.910
those people feel a little bit more open

00:07:03.010 00:07:06.420
and feel kind of not so insecure or kind

00:07:06.490 00:07:07.890
of you know you're not standing out so

00:07:07.990 00:07:10.050
much in you much you realize that people

00:07:10.590 00:07:13.110
who who you know I know that'll be your

00:07:13.480 00:07:14.160
friends you know you might be just

00:07:14.350 00:07:15.180
colleagues people don't really know

00:07:15.460 00:07:17.340
suddenly like quitter open se but you

00:07:17.500 00:07:19.880
just kind of walk me to the bar please

00:07:20.890 00:07:22.910
do you mind if you just kind of then

00:07:23.920 00:07:25.320
move those people on the way second come

00:07:25.480 00:07:27.750
and kind of make it run free without

00:07:28.300 00:07:30.690
falling over don't think that's really

00:07:30.820 00:07:32.160
nice discuss quite nice it helps it

00:07:32.410 00:07:46.290
gives you more confidence I think so you

00:07:46.480 00:07:48.120
know David I saw David the other week

00:07:48.580 00:07:50.160
ended you know certain things he can do

00:07:50.410 00:07:51.780
certain things I can do between us were

00:07:51.940 00:08:03.240
almost like a yeah it makes you laugh

00:08:03.700 00:08:04.890
even more so you know to make you laugh

00:08:05.050 00:08:06.780
I laugh at myself in them toss you

00:08:06.910 00:08:08.460
around the house something on one of the

00:08:10.320 00:08:14.040
units and I was really slowing them and

00:08:14.140 00:08:15.510
they obviously find if they've been if

00:08:15.700 00:08:17.130
you'd find this I don't if you get slow

00:08:17.350 00:08:19.620
and if I walk backwards I can walk an

00:08:19.900 00:08:24.540
awful lot faster people yeah so I was in

00:08:24.640 00:08:26.280
the kitchen and maybe we take it man I

00:08:26.530 00:08:28.170
had two plates of food and they needed

00:08:28.270 00:08:29.610
to take you through to the lounge so I

00:08:29.890 00:08:31.320
just decided to walk but this is much

00:08:31.690 00:08:33.000
easier I'm laughing at myself as I do

00:08:33.280 00:08:37.800
Michael Jackson moon walking like what

00:08:37.930 00:08:47.820
am I doing here this is ridiculous on

00:08:47.980 00:08:51.340
the floor I can see

00:08:52.350 00:08:54.410
let's say you know most evenings and lay

00:08:54.570 00:08:54.980
on the floor

00:08:55.500 00:08:57.350
Calico big nose picking up all this nice

00:08:57.720 00:08:58.970
comfy cities but I need to lie on the

00:08:59.040 00:09:12.019
floor like 2:37 lighten up ya think say

00:09:12.360 00:09:13.790
cuz otherwise I think you can get you

00:09:13.980 00:09:16.460
can get yourself so down if you really

00:09:16.649 00:09:18.050
thought about it how you can really get

00:09:18.360 00:09:19.579
yourselves very depressing quite down

00:09:19.800 00:09:21.230
about certain I think now I'm not saying

00:09:21.449 00:09:23.300
me you don't have those dark days you do

00:09:23.399 00:09:24.710
you have the rainy days in the dry days

00:09:24.899 00:09:27.110
at best places - your dessert you know

00:09:27.420 00:09:28.939
and we all get them out of rainy day you

00:09:29.190 00:09:30.410
live potatoes like this is horrible I

00:09:30.630 00:10:33.590
hate it roller ah yeah I think yeah I

00:10:34.470 00:10:37.280
mean for me I mean I think I'm not

00:10:37.350 00:10:40.790
really had many what the word is

00:10:40.920 00:10:42.949
actually alone thinking it's nothing

00:10:42.990 00:10:44.900
that noticeable other parks is so that

00:10:45.180 00:10:46.579
because now just I mean I'm not into the

00:10:46.889 00:10:48.740
six year known to have convinced him six

00:10:48.930 00:10:51.199
year and then I would say it was

00:10:51.300 00:10:52.550
probably about two years ago where

00:10:52.589 00:10:54.379
people suddenly start to notice a little

00:10:54.540 00:10:56.480
bit more a little bit slower a little

00:10:56.880 00:10:59.449
bit or and I get really bad cramp from

00:10:59.670 00:11:01.220
the feet which i think is now turned to

00:11:01.620 00:11:03.000
stone exits all my life

00:11:03.970 00:11:06.509
nuts what's really restricting me so

00:11:06.730 00:11:08.819
anything that really frustrates me I

00:11:09.040 00:11:11.610
think is just so sudden inability to not

00:11:11.740 00:11:15.540
be else of walk when you kind of between

00:11:16.209 00:11:24.629
officers it's quite difficult it's

00:11:24.850 00:11:25.980
become like a joke amongst my old

00:11:26.380 00:11:27.150
colleagues and stuff so we call it

00:11:27.430 00:11:38.180
pulling over to the side of the road

00:11:50.410 00:11:52.379
yeah II like that the other day um you

00:11:52.510 00:11:54.240

00:11:54.430 00:11:57.150
little bit and that's a half tablet

00:11:57.760 00:12:00.480
multiple kick in and start to get gas in

00:12:00.699 00:12:01.650
the building and its treatment

00:12:01.810 00:12:03.300

00:12:11.319 00:12:12.269
waiting and other people are walking

00:12:12.579 00:12:14.579
past me and I'm - Cisco something much

00:12:14.829 00:12:16.290
it's quite busy and I appreciate the

00:12:16.449 00:12:17.550
fact that I think I would probably look

00:12:17.829 00:12:19.139
twice at something like you know I think

00:12:19.449 00:12:20.850

00:13:05.949 00:13:07.170
scared so actually in Emerald there is

00:13:07.360 00:13:12.300
some really nice people other and the

00:13:12.490 00:13:13.889
thing is I think you know you can sort

00:13:14.019 00:13:15.720
of understand the fear a little bit you

00:13:16.270 00:13:17.760

00:13:18.190 00:13:19.370
terrorism and stuff like that everyone's

00:13:20.380 00:13:23.040
worried I think you know it's a disease

00:13:23.800 00:13:25.350
but you know I'd like to think that you

00:13:25.830 00:13:27.750
know there's enough kind of people out

00:13:27.790 00:13:29.280
there that are kind of kind of step over

00:13:29.440 00:13:32.130
that fare in sort of you know in helping

00:13:32.830 00:13:34.560
but it's you know it's also like what

00:13:34.750 00:13:53.090
can someone do in that situation and I

00:13:54.100 00:13:55.350
was walking down the back street and

00:13:55.930 00:13:57.120

00:15:40.480 00:17:23.549
this is yes so what would you say is

00:17:23.650 00:17:25.319
your most troubling to at the moment

00:17:25.390 00:17:29.850
would you say it's yeah yes definitely

00:17:30.340 00:17:32.330
Estonia is the worst it's just so

00:17:33.340 00:17:35.100
crippling is very - quite literally it's

00:17:35.230 00:17:36.870
in both feet and then now it's moving on

00:17:37.030 00:17:40.560
the lakes and it's just the the way just

00:17:41.110 00:17:42.240
physically stops you from doing

00:17:42.820 00:17:44.040
wherever you're doing it you kiss code

00:17:44.230 00:17:46.230
which is usually working I stood up and

00:17:47.110 00:17:49.560
it's just so painful it's just like I

00:17:50.350 00:17:59.130
mean I have um I have both does help a

00:17:59.290 00:18:43.320
little bit but we should be we should

00:18:43.690 00:18:44.970
test the shoes you know for Clark's

00:18:45.190 00:18:48.120
because I love Clark's so nice I find

00:18:48.280 00:18:49.950
that I've actually I'd fitting ones and

00:18:49.990 00:18:50.940
I think you're looking at again I'm

00:18:51.460 00:18:53.550
wearing old woman's shoes are so comfy

00:19:07.470 00:19:10.080
the trendy stuff like what cool ranges

00:19:10.330 00:19:12.480
make it quick quick quick quick and kind

00:19:12.610 00:19:16.290
of collectibles well Perry feels from

00:19:16.450 00:19:18.510
there that no one knows the clocks on

00:19:18.670 00:19:26.460
them and I'm like yep we're close

00:19:26.590 00:19:40.590
Oh mom I know the brilliant say what

00:19:40.780 00:19:42.720
would you say if Parkinson's was a

00:19:43.150 00:19:44.160
person it was not in front of you right

00:19:44.200 00:19:47.640
now what would you say to it my commits

00:19:51.260 00:20:38.240
I would say what piece of advice would

00:20:38.520 00:20:47.920
you give to someone who's been newly

00:20:48.930 00:20:52.340
diagnosed I believe this is a few things

00:20:52.500 00:20:57.620
I'm sorry I can't think of one yeah I

00:20:57.840 00:20:59.180
think there's a few things I think very

00:20:59.280 00:21:01.340
I mean well I think I went wrong as I

00:21:01.710 00:21:04.280
didn't maybe invest some time in it and

00:21:04.530 00:21:05.840
kind of finding out a bit more about the

00:21:06.300 00:21:07.670
condition I basically said give me some

00:21:08.010 00:21:09.650
medication ailments have it it'll fix

00:21:10.400 00:21:12.050
everything and there wasn't enough

00:21:12.450 00:21:14.060
support there even though I was looking

00:21:14.280 00:21:16.310
to have a and I'm K numerologists and

00:21:16.530 00:21:18.560
the support of the parks isness which

00:21:19.230 00:21:20.570
Manchester a sort of royal embrace that

00:21:21.420 00:21:23.390
have about three or four parts to this

00:21:23.640 00:21:33.230
we're very look you don't come I think I

00:21:33.630 00:21:35.300
still feel that I felt I think you

00:21:35.730 00:21:37.760
needed more support and information of

00:21:37.980 00:21:39.770
how what the next step was it because

00:21:39.840 00:21:41.270
you just didn't know what was gonna

00:21:41.400 00:21:43.370
happen you do is like it everything it

00:21:43.890 00:21:45.560
completely shifted your life can I

00:21:45.780 00:21:47.480
slightly change but it happened it's

00:21:47.580 00:21:48.680
just a little something else coming

00:21:48.960 00:21:50.380
along with you it's just the one from

00:21:51.390 00:21:52.640
Parkinson's and I kind of thought we

00:21:52.950 00:21:55.310
nice to have someone of a similar age or

00:21:55.530 00:21:58.190
so Callum may be diagnosed to 3 years

00:21:58.890 00:22:00.230
you know a lot maybe four years down the

00:22:00.270 00:22:01.130
road there

00:22:01.740 00:22:03.140
Merson they can maybe offer you some

00:22:03.510 00:22:05.090
support by saying it's not quite but if

00:22:05.190 00:22:06.830
you think you know good good days and

00:22:06.960 00:22:09.080
bad days so for me I think you're

00:22:09.950 00:22:12.170
thinking if you knew diagnosed don't

00:22:12.420 00:22:13.490
scare yourself on the internet and

00:22:13.890 00:22:15.860
looking elsif but maybe just help make

00:22:16.080 00:22:20.630
sure you kind of give yourself some go

00:22:21.060 00:22:21.800
look for support

00:22:22.170 00:22:23.960
go online and don't go to your local

00:22:24.360 00:22:25.430
group because the people who are older

00:22:25.620 00:22:27.890
being used together have like some I'm a

00:22:28.290 00:22:29.900
giving young group of people support be

00:22:30.300 00:22:31.970
online be it face in focus whatever

00:22:32.460 00:22:34.130
thinking then just kind of take it from

00:22:34.260 00:22:35.480
now and take each day as it comes I

00:22:35.700 00:22:36.860
don't think you should look too far into

00:22:37.080 00:22:40.100
the future that's my I think my thinking

00:22:40.890 00:22:42.320
you just kind of flies but I think for

00:22:42.450 00:22:44.120
me is you can get it really down about

00:22:44.430 00:22:45.530
and it's horrible and I hate it

00:22:45.720 00:22:48.170
sometimes really hate it but I can only

00:22:48.360 00:22:50.480
you've just got to carry on you've got

00:22:50.520 00:23:00.659
to be surprised if bulimia
