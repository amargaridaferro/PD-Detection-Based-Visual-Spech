00:00:00.630 00:00:02.270
good to great by Jim Collins now this

00:00:02.490 00:00:04.640
book is all about why some companies go

00:00:04.920 00:00:06.920
from being good to being great while

00:00:07.259 00:00:09.169
other companies actually go from being

00:00:09.570 00:00:11.870
good to being mediocre and at some point

00:00:12.000 00:00:13.970
just ceasing to exist why does that

00:00:14.880 00:00:16.939
now the writer of this book Jim Collins

00:00:17.190 00:00:19.460
is actually a professor at Stanford

00:00:19.710 00:00:21.290
Business School and he did a lot of

00:00:21.810 00:00:22.849
research on this topic him and his

00:00:23.070 00:00:24.320
colleagues did a bunch of research to

00:00:24.689 00:00:25.970
analyze all these different companies

00:00:26.130 00:00:27.890
they actually analyzed all the different

00:00:28.470 00:00:29.660
companies that went from good to great

00:00:29.699 00:00:31.310
and their competitors during the same

00:00:31.500 00:00:34.400
era to figure out what is it what was

00:00:34.710 00:00:36.080
the thing that made the difference what

00:00:36.570 00:00:37.700
exactly was it they actually interviewed

00:00:37.980 00:00:39.889
the CEOs they interviewed the the teams

00:00:40.530 00:00:41.959
they went and did all the research they

00:00:42.120 00:00:43.700
did the numbers and this book is

00:00:44.070 00:00:46.700
actually an output of all of that what

00:00:46.860 00:00:48.860
is it why is it that some companies make

00:00:49.020 00:00:50.750
the leap why do some companies become

00:00:50.969 00:00:52.430
great so let's talk about it let's talk

00:00:52.500 00:00:54.139
about some of the biggest ideas from

00:00:54.360 00:00:56.060
this book the first big idea I want to

00:00:56.219 00:00:57.290
talk to you about is the Stockdale

00:00:57.329 00:00:59.029
paradox this is something that Jim

00:00:59.399 00:01:01.069
Collins learned from Admiral Jim

00:01:01.649 00:01:03.500
Stockdale who was a prisoner of war in

00:01:03.539 00:01:05.870
the Vietnam wars he actually survived

00:01:06.180 00:01:08.300
those prisons and Jim Collins when he

00:01:08.700 00:01:10.580
interviewed Jim Stockdale about why

00:01:11.070 00:01:13.039
certain prisoners survived while others

00:01:13.470 00:01:14.859
didn't he found a very interesting

00:01:15.869 00:01:17.149
analogy what he found was it's very

00:01:17.460 00:01:18.830
similar to what happens with businesses

00:01:19.170 00:01:20.359
now here's what happened the prisoners

00:01:20.520 00:01:22.580
of war who did not survive were either

00:01:22.920 00:01:24.260
the ones who were blindly optimistic

00:01:25.200 00:01:27.620
about getting out of there and actually

00:01:28.020 00:01:30.020
surviving the prisons or who were very

00:01:30.299 00:01:32.179
pessimistic but the ones who survived

00:01:32.820 00:01:34.700
for majority of them were the ones who

00:01:35.009 00:01:37.370
actually were optimistic but at the same

00:01:37.740 00:01:39.319
time they were able to confront the

00:01:39.659 00:01:41.749
brutal facts the reality as it was today

00:01:42.180 00:01:43.609
that's why we call it a paradox on the

00:01:43.829 00:01:46.190
one hand is the reality of today which

00:01:46.229 00:01:48.560
is very hard very harsh very difficult

00:01:48.630 00:01:50.630
very tough on the other hand you're

00:01:50.909 00:01:52.310
still able to dream big you're still

00:01:52.530 00:01:54.530
able to believe that you will survive

00:01:54.780 00:01:56.030
that you'll make it out of here you

00:01:56.280 00:01:57.440
still have the vision that you will make

00:01:57.659 00:01:59.300
out of these prisons while on the other

00:01:59.520 00:02:01.399
hand you realize it is tough it is

00:02:01.950 00:02:04.340
grueling it is painful it is really

00:02:04.560 00:02:06.200
really really crushing and that's the

00:02:06.420 00:02:08.330
same way with business we have to

00:02:08.670 00:02:10.520
realize we have to have that vision that

00:02:10.800 00:02:13.080
no matter what we will prevail that we

00:02:13.360 00:02:14.910
do great things but at the same time we

00:02:15.069 00:02:16.920
have to confront the brutal facts of

00:02:17.290 00:02:19.020
today we have to confront the reality of

00:02:19.239 00:02:21.300
today which might mean that we have to

00:02:21.610 00:02:22.890
confirm the fact that it is hard right

00:02:23.020 00:02:24.900
now that we might be in trouble right

00:02:25.209 00:02:27.089
now that the numbers are not good right

00:02:27.310 00:02:29.580
now that this is a lot of work that this

00:02:29.709 00:02:31.229
is going to be really painful and that's

00:02:31.690 00:02:33.809
okay so we have to confront the fact

00:02:34.090 00:02:35.670
that this is going to be hard this could

00:02:35.800 00:02:37.110
be ten times harder than what we

00:02:37.720 00:02:39.360
anticipated it to be and that's quite

00:02:39.550 00:02:41.190
okay because we still believe in the

00:02:41.410 00:02:43.020
fact that we will make it that we will

00:02:43.269 00:02:44.850
do great things so that's a paradox a

00:02:45.310 00:02:47.070
huge paradox here the next big idea I

00:02:47.200 00:02:48.090
want to talk to you about is the

00:02:48.670 00:02:50.550
Hedgehog concept now the Hedgehog and

00:02:51.069 00:02:52.410
the Fox we're gonna compare these two

00:02:52.569 00:02:55.140
animals the Fox is the exact opposite of

00:02:55.269 00:02:57.210
the Hedgehog the fog sees the world in

00:02:57.610 00:03:00.030
all the complexity it looks for all the

00:03:00.310 00:03:02.430
shiny objects its scatters its energy

00:03:02.650 00:03:04.620
all over the place the Hedgehog on the

00:03:04.810 00:03:06.960
other hand it sees to all the complexity

00:03:07.180 00:03:09.089
and it focuses its energy on a few

00:03:09.370 00:03:11.070
things that truly matter a few things

00:03:11.260 00:03:13.199
that truly move the dial so the Hedgehog

00:03:13.720 00:03:15.270
always comes out a winner and that's how

00:03:15.580 00:03:16.620
great businesses are they are like

00:03:17.140 00:03:19.110
hedgehogs they're trying to do a few

00:03:19.450 00:03:21.060
things really well rather than trying to

00:03:21.250 00:03:23.220
do a lot of different things the Fox on

00:03:23.290 00:03:24.630
the other hand represents a failing

00:03:24.910 00:03:26.640
business or a mediocre business at best

00:03:27.070 00:03:28.380
because it's spreading its energy all

00:03:28.420 00:03:30.330
over the place and it cannot focus on a

00:03:30.489 00:03:32.190
few things that truly matter so if you

00:03:32.620 00:03:34.110
want to grow your business it no matter

00:03:34.480 00:03:36.150
what stage of growth you're in you've

00:03:36.190 00:03:38.819
got to condense you've got to focus on a

00:03:39.010 00:03:40.319
few things that truly matter rather than

00:03:40.569 00:03:42.690
doing a whole bunch of things I've seen

00:03:43.269 00:03:44.580
businesses of all sizes whether they're

00:03:44.920 00:03:46.110
million dollars five million dollars ten

00:03:46.329 00:03:47.460
million dollars and they're struggling

00:03:47.829 00:03:49.259
and you can see the struggle because

00:03:49.510 00:03:51.270
they are diffused they're all over the

00:03:51.310 00:03:52.530
place you're doing a lot of different

00:03:52.600 00:03:53.970
things in fact I have seen people who

00:03:54.100 00:03:55.229
are in the early stages of building a

00:03:55.359 00:03:56.910
business and they're committing the same

00:03:57.220 00:03:58.349
sin they're trying to do so many

00:03:58.660 00:03:59.879
different things that they end up losing

00:04:00.220 00:04:01.920
the whole battle of business because

00:04:02.079 00:04:04.470
they cannot they cannot afford to spread

00:04:04.660 00:04:05.910
their energy all over the place I've

00:04:06.069 00:04:07.410
actually come across people who are

00:04:07.810 00:04:09.150
starting off a podcast and a YouTube

00:04:09.489 00:04:10.590
channel and a blog and an instagram

00:04:10.900 00:04:12.360
channel and a Facebook live feed all of

00:04:12.519 00:04:14.309
them at the same time and when I see

00:04:14.500 00:04:16.259
that I'm very worried about that person

00:04:16.510 00:04:18.150
because I know they're not going to

00:04:18.609 00:04:19.560
succeed at this venture they're gonna

00:04:19.870 00:04:21.029
spread their energy all over the place

00:04:21.190 00:04:22.350
they're going to try all these different

00:04:22.450 00:04:23.670
things and none of them are gonna work

00:04:24.430 00:04:25.990
instead what we need to do but

00:04:26.150 00:04:27.520
your businesses and six figures are

00:04:27.860 00:04:28.900
seven figures or eight figures it

00:04:29.180 00:04:30.520
doesn't matter you got to focus you've

00:04:30.710 00:04:32.590
got to do a few things that really move

00:04:32.780 00:04:34.720
the dial this book actually this book is

00:04:35.000 00:04:36.610
not just for someone who's starting a

00:04:36.740 00:04:38.200
business in fact this book is designed

00:04:38.600 00:04:41.050
for fortune 500 companies fortune 500

00:04:41.330 00:04:42.190
companies are committing the same

00:04:42.770 00:04:44.260
problems that other entrepreneurs

00:04:44.660 00:04:45.790
early-stage entrepreneurs online

00:04:46.340 00:04:47.260
entrepreneurs are committing the same

00:04:47.990 00:04:49.180
problem the lack of focus is killing

00:04:49.580 00:04:51.160
businesses all across and that was one

00:04:52.280 00:04:53.680
Apple was able to do really well Steve

00:04:53.990 00:04:56.050
Jobs was a master of focus he was always

00:04:56.240 00:04:58.030
able to say no and that's one thing we

00:04:58.220 00:04:59.680
need to learn we need to learn in our

00:04:59.930 00:05:01.840
online businesses to be able to say no a

00:05:02.150 00:05:04.390
whole lot more to focus a whole lot more

00:05:04.880 00:05:06.460
rather than just spraying our energy all

00:05:06.770 00:05:08.440
over the place in a diffuse manner like

00:05:08.720 00:05:12.070
a fox so be like a hedgehog not like a

00:05:12.380 00:05:14.350
fox the next big idea is the idea of the

00:05:14.600 00:05:16.360
three intersecting circles where should

00:05:16.460 00:05:17.740
you focus all of your energy we just

00:05:17.930 00:05:19.330
talked about the Hedgehog concept as in

00:05:19.790 00:05:21.670
the key to success is to focus your

00:05:21.950 00:05:22.900
energy but where should you focus your

00:05:23.150 00:05:25.240
energy well it is at the intersection of

00:05:25.490 00:05:27.790
these three circles the first of those

00:05:28.190 00:05:29.500
circles is what is it that you can be

00:05:29.630 00:05:31.570
the best in the world at the best in the

00:05:31.669 00:05:34.120
world you can be not what you want to be

00:05:34.220 00:05:35.620
the best in the world but what you can

00:05:35.780 00:05:37.630
be the best in the world second thing is

00:05:38.210 00:05:39.550
what you're truly passionate about and

00:05:39.860 00:05:41.830
the third is what is it that drives the

00:05:42.260 00:05:43.630
economic engine so when you are at the

00:05:44.060 00:05:45.040
intersection of these three things what

00:05:45.200 00:05:46.540
you're passionate about what you can be

00:05:46.640 00:05:48.159
the best in the world at and what really

00:05:48.410 00:05:50.080
makes money the intersection right there

00:05:50.270 00:05:51.580
is where you want to focus all of your

00:05:51.710 00:05:53.380
energy now here's the amazing thing this

00:05:53.570 00:05:56.020
is as true for a multi-billion dollar of

00:05:56.479 00:05:58.510
fortune 500 company as it is for a

00:05:59.030 00:06:00.580
six-figure entrepreneur or even for a

00:06:01.010 00:06:02.020
starting entrepreneur it doesn't matter

00:06:02.570 00:06:04.240
it stays the same the ideas do not

00:06:04.820 00:06:06.490
change the principles the basics of

00:06:06.740 00:06:08.050
business do not change and this is one

00:06:08.090 00:06:09.700
of those fundamental basics of business

00:06:10.340 00:06:12.100
you've got to focus your energy on the

00:06:12.590 00:06:13.719
intersection of these three circles what

00:06:13.820 00:06:15.670
are these three circles again passion

00:06:16.400 00:06:18.670
what you can be great at and what drives

00:06:18.919 00:06:20.530
the economic engine or where you make

00:06:20.690 00:06:22.630
money so if you can find out in that

00:06:23.270 00:06:24.580
intersection where exactly your sweet

00:06:24.860 00:06:26.650
spot is you will be able to apply the

00:06:27.110 00:06:28.630
Hedgehog concept really well so if you

00:06:28.820 00:06:30.580
can focus in on that intersection of

00:06:30.830 00:06:32.020
these three circles you can actually

00:06:32.479 00:06:34.510
build a great business rather than build

00:06:34.700 00:06:36.250
a failing business or rather than build

00:06:36.380 00:06:37.140
a business

00:06:37.270 00:06:39.300
there ends up being mediocre alright so

00:06:39.970 00:06:41.220
make sure to focus on those three

00:06:41.650 00:06:43.080
intersecting circles the next big idea

00:06:43.390 00:06:45.480
is the flywheel principle imagine you

00:06:45.670 00:06:48.450
have a 5,000 pound giant flywheel and

00:06:48.760 00:06:50.160
you need to get it to spin you need to

00:06:50.350 00:06:51.750
get it to rotate really fast what do you

00:06:51.910 00:06:53.550
do you start pushing you start pushing

00:06:53.800 00:06:55.050
in one direction and keep pushing you

00:06:55.270 00:06:56.550
keep pushing you keep pushing you keep

00:06:56.770 00:06:58.230
pushing you keep consistently pushing

00:06:58.990 00:07:00.420
until it starts to get momentum and then

00:07:00.550 00:07:02.310
you keep pushing even more to get even

00:07:02.500 00:07:04.110
more momentum and to get it to go even

00:07:04.300 00:07:05.430
faster and faster and faster and faster

00:07:06.100 00:07:08.490
faster that's what great businesses do

00:07:09.160 00:07:11.490
they get of giant flywheel to go really

00:07:11.740 00:07:13.080
fast that's how they operate their

00:07:13.570 00:07:14.940
business they keep consistently putting

00:07:15.070 00:07:17.310
an effort on that one thing and keep

00:07:17.710 00:07:18.840
pushing keep pushing keep pushing keep

00:07:19.030 00:07:21.120
pushing on the other hand the mediocre

00:07:21.610 00:07:22.530
businesses and the failing businesses

00:07:22.720 00:07:24.330
what do they do they have a bunch of

00:07:24.490 00:07:25.740
different fly views that they're trying

00:07:25.810 00:07:27.990
to rotate not only that even the primary

00:07:28.690 00:07:29.430
flywheel that they're trying to rotate

00:07:29.800 00:07:31.350
they'll go after a misguided acquisition

00:07:31.570 00:07:33.060
or they're going to suddenly start a new

00:07:33.670 00:07:34.920
marketing campaign or new marketing

00:07:35.650 00:07:37.470
channel or a new marketing effort even

00:07:37.690 00:07:38.700
though something was working they're

00:07:38.830 00:07:40.140
gonna start something else because the

00:07:40.390 00:07:41.550
shiny objects aren't the kicks in and

00:07:41.680 00:07:42.930
they want to try something new so

00:07:43.240 00:07:44.880
whatever momentum they had gained on one

00:07:45.100 00:07:46.860
thing is suddenly lost and then they go

00:07:46.990 00:07:48.210
on to other thing and they tried to

00:07:48.610 00:07:48.960
rotate it again

00:07:49.180 00:07:50.310
and it doesn't work and then they try

00:07:50.380 00:07:51.870
the third thing and then do the same

00:07:51.940 00:07:53.370
thing again and again they keep going

00:07:53.590 00:07:55.560
from one to other to third one to fourth

00:07:55.960 00:07:57.600
flywheel or keep rotating the flywheel

00:07:57.730 00:07:58.860
in different directions hoping that

00:07:59.200 00:08:01.260
somehow the flywheel will just magically

00:08:01.570 00:08:03.180
start to rotate really fast but that's

00:08:03.340 00:08:05.250
not happening there is no magic moment

00:08:05.440 00:08:08.070
