00:00:05.130 00:00:07.249
hi I don't know why I'm going live

00:00:07.529 00:00:09.379
because I'm not sure I certainly don't

00:00:09.660 00:00:11.209
want people that know me to see this but

00:00:11.519 00:00:15.110
I thought I would just try this out

00:00:15.809 00:00:18.050
so about six weeks ago I was diagnosed

00:00:18.150 00:00:20.840
with Parkinson's and my husband said you

00:00:21.210 00:00:24.170
should start to journal about it well I

00:00:24.750 00:00:26.779
have Parkinson's and my handwriting was

00:00:27.060 00:00:30.230
never good to begin with but it's even

00:00:30.359 00:00:33.470
worse now and even typing I tend to type

00:00:33.660 00:00:35.560
with one hand so I don't have as much

00:00:36.570 00:00:38.060
speed as I used to so then I thought

00:00:38.340 00:00:41.500
well why don't my video tape about it so

00:00:42.510 00:00:44.500
I'm what's called young onset

00:00:45.510 00:00:46.819
Parkinson's disease I'm not that young

00:00:47.070 00:00:49.220
I'm probably on the older side of young

00:00:49.710 00:00:51.770
onset Parkinson's but generally people

00:00:51.989 00:00:53.569
think of Parkinson's as an old person's

00:00:53.969 00:00:57.680
disease and so it's just very

00:00:57.960 00:01:01.580
frustrating so I'm hoping to maybe

00:01:02.340 00:01:05.149
chronicle my journey in the hopes that

00:01:05.580 00:01:08.359
it will help other people that may be

00:01:09.060 00:01:11.240
diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's

00:01:11.369 00:01:12.560
or even people that are diagnosed with

00:01:13.439 00:01:16.640
Parkinson's disease I feel like you know

00:01:17.220 00:01:19.580
there are other awful things that you

00:01:19.799 00:01:21.380
can get worse actually in my opinion

00:01:21.869 00:01:24.380
than Parkinson's like but there's more

00:01:24.780 00:01:26.899
support you know so if you were

00:01:27.360 00:01:28.670
diagnosed with cancer I feel like then

00:01:28.799 00:01:30.289
you get to be in the cancer Club and

00:01:30.420 00:01:32.630
there's a lot of people in the cancer

00:01:32.820 00:01:35.359
world and it's a horrible diagnosis and

00:01:35.670 00:01:37.490
I'm not saying that I wish for it I just

00:01:37.920 00:01:40.249
wish for the support does that make

00:01:41.340 00:01:43.850
so what I'm hoping to do is create a

00:01:44.250 00:01:46.700
network of people on YouTube that maybe

00:01:46.920 00:01:49.760
we can interact I went to a Parkinson's

00:01:50.689 00:01:54.230
fair last weekend and one of the vendors

00:01:54.509 00:01:55.819
said well there's a lot of young people

00:01:56.189 00:01:57.709
in North I live in North Florida and

00:01:58.290 00:02:00.050
North Florida with Parkinson's and I was

00:02:00.240 00:02:02.120
like really gosh that's so that's kind

00:02:02.159 00:02:03.800
of good news I mean good news from a

00:02:04.170 00:02:04.700
support network

00:02:05.040 00:02:08.210
she said yeah there's at least 10 well

00:02:08.759 00:02:12.860
10 people in a in a you know with

00:02:13.379 00:02:13.940
millions of

00:02:14.400 00:02:15.770
other people I don't know ten just

00:02:16.050 00:02:17.620
didn't seem like a high number to me so

00:02:18.630 00:02:20.630
maybe it is a high number but it just

00:02:20.910 00:02:22.070
didn't seem like that to me

00:02:22.910 00:02:26.260
so so anyway I'm hoping to create this

00:02:27.270 00:02:28.850
YouTube channel just for us to kind of

00:02:29.310 00:02:30.500
interact and maybe you can give me

00:02:30.720 00:02:33.850
feedback and I'll give you feedback and

00:02:34.860 00:02:36.440
maybe you can comment below and just let

00:02:36.540 00:02:38.900
me know what your thoughts are with

00:02:39.660 00:02:40.640
Parkinsons and how you kind of dealt

00:02:40.709 00:02:44.030
with it so the way I was diagnosed is I

00:02:44.790 00:02:48.259
went to well I lost my sense of smell

00:02:48.750 00:02:50.270
about three years ago so I don't know if

00:02:50.519 00:02:52.699
that's a common thing or but it is tends

00:02:52.920 00:02:55.400
to be a potential sign of Parkinson's

00:02:55.620 00:02:57.440
which I didn't know at the time then

00:02:57.840 00:02:59.240
both my shoulders froze because with

00:02:59.760 00:03:01.070
Parkinson's you tend not to have as much

00:03:01.709 00:03:04.580
movements but again never related losing

00:03:04.709 00:03:07.190
my sense of smell with my shoulders

00:03:07.590 00:03:08.720
freezing which happens to be a very

00:03:10.100 00:03:12.620
painful issue so hopefully none of you

00:03:12.810 00:03:14.420
have that I feel like I won the lottery

00:03:14.610 00:03:17.240
I got Parkinson's and not just one but

00:03:17.459 00:03:19.610
both my shoulders froze so there it is

00:03:19.950 00:03:21.680
they're almost unfrozen but still pretty

00:03:21.989 00:03:25.580
painful and and then I started tremoring

00:03:25.920 00:03:27.620
and I thought that because I had a

00:03:27.840 00:03:29.240
frozen shoulder I really thought that

00:03:29.549 00:03:30.670
maybe I pinched a nerve or something

00:03:31.680 00:03:33.319
anyway long story short I finally went

00:03:33.450 00:03:35.780
to the neurologist to schedule an MRI

00:03:36.420 00:03:38.479
because somebody several people as a

00:03:38.670 00:03:40.280
matter of fact said you really should

00:03:40.890 00:03:42.650
have an MRI just go see what's going on

00:03:42.900 00:03:43.789
why don't you have a sense of smell

00:03:44.250 00:03:47.030
that's not normal so years later I

00:03:47.579 00:03:50.449
decide alright I'll go get an MRI and I

00:03:51.060 00:03:53.000
sit down with the neurologist and he's

00:03:53.430 00:03:55.099
taking me through all these tests and by

00:03:55.170 00:03:56.270
the way I think I'm doing really well

00:03:56.730 00:03:58.490
squeeze my hand I'm like oh a lot of

00:03:58.920 00:03:59.960
strength I'm squeezing his hand it

00:04:00.239 00:04:02.300
probably hurts and all this other stuff

00:04:02.790 00:04:04.190
for like an hour he's having me walk

00:04:04.560 00:04:05.840
he's having me do this yeah it's having

00:04:05.970 00:04:08.569
me this and I sit down and he's like

00:04:09.390 00:04:11.690
well I hate to tell you this but I think

00:04:12.090 00:04:14.629
your Parkinson's and I'm like I beg your

00:04:14.780 00:04:16.909
pardon this is an appointment to

00:04:17.310 00:04:18.890
schedule an MRI this is not a diagnostic

00:04:19.650 00:04:21.949
appointment so needless to say I was

00:04:22.200 00:04:25.460
pretty shocked I didn't really I just it

00:04:25.500 00:04:27.780
just was so unexpected

00:04:27.970 00:04:29.940
so come to find out just FYI in case you

00:04:30.160 00:04:32.580
didn't know it there's not really like

00:04:32.740 00:04:38.240
an MRI or a particular screen that is

00:04:39.250 00:04:41.790
that can detect Parkinson's it really is

00:04:41.830 00:04:44.630
a symptomatic

00:04:45.640 00:04:47.100
diagnosis I also went to a Parkinson's

00:04:47.770 00:04:49.830
specialist who confirmed it where I did

00:04:50.020 00:04:51.360
bring my husband actually because I

00:04:51.940 00:04:56.610
wanted him there and so that's just

00:04:57.130 00:04:59.430
that's how I found out and like I said

00:04:59.680 00:05:01.170
it was pretty shocking especially

00:05:01.960 00:05:02.940
shocking because I always thought

00:05:03.640 00:05:06.780
Parkinson's and older people but it can

00:05:07.060 00:05:08.730
strike at any age as evidenced by

00:05:09.160 00:05:11.970
Michael J Fox of course he was he's

00:05:12.280 00:05:14.790
probably my age now but it's been you

00:05:14.830 00:05:16.740
know two decades of his having

00:05:17.470 00:05:20.160
Parkinson's I think so anyway like I

00:05:20.290 00:05:26.130
said I hope this is a helpful video for

00:05:26.410 00:05:28.320
people to watch as they start exploring

00:05:28.720 00:05:30.060
this disease and I'll check back every

00:05:30.430 00:05:31.980
couple days tomorrow I'm actually going

00:05:32.050 00:05:35.490
to go to my first Parkinson's exercise

00:05:36.030 00:05:38.130
group again at this fair I found this

00:05:38.440 00:05:40.080
group and it's for Parkinson's and their

00:05:40.780 00:05:43.080
caregivers and it freaks me out just a

00:05:43.120 00:05:44.400
little bit because I don't have a

00:05:44.680 00:05:47.100
caregiver I'm pretty mobile I mean my

00:05:47.350 00:05:50.670
hand tremors but and I'm slow you know

00:05:51.100 00:05:52.380
that is something that is so frustrating

00:05:52.870 00:05:55.170
with Parkinson's takes me you know five

00:05:55.870 00:05:57.030
seconds to pull up my pants where he

00:05:57.190 00:06:00.360
used to take me half a second and I used

00:06:00.490 00:06:02.580
to joke that people would my family we'd

00:06:02.710 00:06:04.860
all be in the car going for breakfast or

00:06:05.020 00:06:07.320
something and I would take me so long to

00:06:07.540 00:06:08.850
get out of the car they had their menus

00:06:09.100 00:06:11.250
they're seated in the restaurant and

00:06:11.500 00:06:13.020
they're already ordered while I'm just

00:06:13.210 00:06:15.180
still getting out of the car so some of

00:06:15.250 00:06:16.890
the frustrating things for me with

00:06:17.470 00:06:19.320
Parkinson's is the minute tremoring of

00:06:19.540 00:06:23.880
course is frustrating and the slowness

00:06:24.190 00:06:26.010
is particularly frustrating maybe you

00:06:26.290 00:06:27.870
wouldn't probably notice if you saw me

00:06:28.210 00:06:29.490
well maybe the tremors but the other

00:06:29.770 00:06:30.930
things I don't think you'd notice so

00:06:31.150 00:06:36.690
much so anyway I I'm going to go to this

00:06:37.180 00:06:38.910
exercise class I will check in tomorrow

00:06:38.950 00:06:40.470
or the next day and just let you know

00:06:40.630 00:06:43.550
how it was

00:06:44.560 00:06:46.589
yeah so like I said hopefully this is

00:06:46.810 00:06:48.600
helpful for people and I will keep

00:06:48.819 00:06:50.730
checking back and if you happen to have

00:06:51.370 00:06:52.709
Parkinson's I would love to hear your

00:06:52.990 00:06:55.499
comments and certainly just must be

00:06:55.659 00:06:57.140
below thank you bye
