00:00:01.110 00:00:02.629
I'm dr. Todd lies on from light

00:00:03.330 00:00:05.360
integration and NIR saunas a couple of

00:00:05.490 00:00:07.369
years ago I shot a video on Parkinson's

00:00:07.589 00:00:09.110
and Alzheimer's and it's proven to be

00:00:09.540 00:00:11.330
really popular so a couple of weeks ago

00:00:11.429 00:00:13.249
I decided I wanted to do an update to

00:00:13.349 00:00:14.959
that video because I do get requests for

00:00:15.059 00:00:17.120
that on a fairly regular basis and I

00:00:17.490 00:00:18.529
started looking into the literature

00:00:19.230 00:00:21.380
that's come out since that study was

00:00:21.600 00:00:23.660
done in 2017 so over the last few years

00:00:24.029 00:00:26.540
because we're now into 2019 and I found

00:00:26.730 00:00:28.550
some absolutely fascinating research

00:00:28.859 00:00:30.710
that r.e.m ffice eyes my belief that

00:00:31.529 00:00:33.740
photobiomodulation will be a huge help

00:00:34.380 00:00:36.010
with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's

00:00:37.020 00:00:39.470
into the future now it was a coincidence

00:00:39.690 00:00:42.319
that in the last week a video came out

00:00:42.600 00:00:43.970
onto facebook or at least I became aware

00:00:44.160 00:00:46.100
of this video on Facebook where the ABC

00:00:46.350 00:00:48.500
here in Australia produced a video of a

00:00:48.719 00:00:50.360
case study showing how the application

00:00:50.489 00:00:52.670
of near-infrared lights was helping with

00:00:52.890 00:00:54.560
this particular gentleman's Parkinson's

00:00:55.320 00:00:56.810
situation and it was interesting in the

00:00:57.090 00:00:58.939
video that they noted that the doctor

00:00:59.100 00:01:00.529
that he contacted one of the main

00:01:01.140 00:01:02.810
researchers here in Australia said under

00:01:02.850 00:01:04.789
no circumstances could he recommend this

00:01:04.979 00:01:06.649
for this person because no clinical

00:01:07.080 00:01:08.750
studies have been done in other words we

00:01:08.970 00:01:10.670
don't really know the full effect

00:01:11.040 00:01:13.340
yet but enough research has been out

00:01:13.500 00:01:15.620
there from animals and some I'll show

00:01:15.720 00:01:17.510
you clinical studies in a second but

00:01:18.000 00:01:19.039
it's one of those things where if a

00:01:19.080 00:01:20.780
person decides that they want to do that

00:01:20.970 00:01:22.520
that's up to them but I just want to

00:01:22.619 00:01:24.380
make clear under no circumstances am i

00:01:25.020 00:01:26.780
advocating or giving any medical advice

00:01:27.210 00:01:29.390
with Parkinson's I'm simply sharing the

00:01:29.490 00:01:30.890
information that's out there and

00:01:31.740 00:01:33.109
updating you on exactly where it's

00:01:33.479 00:01:36.830
adding now in 2019 so without all being

00:01:37.110 00:01:40.310
said what's new in the Parkinson's

00:01:40.490 00:01:43.399
research area some fascinating stuff in

00:01:43.500 00:01:46.730
the first one is we now know that remote

00:01:47.670 00:01:50.389
photobiomodulation works what is remote

00:01:51.470 00:01:52.819
photobiomodulation that's where you

00:01:53.369 00:01:55.789
apply the light to an area that's

00:01:56.700 00:01:58.609
distant from the area you're treating so

00:01:59.189 00:02:00.440
usually you think with Parkinson's you

00:02:00.689 00:02:02.840
treat the head in this situation it was

00:02:02.880 00:02:05.690
a mouse study done in 2019 they applied

00:02:05.969 00:02:08.869
the light to the abdomen and the flanks

00:02:09.060 00:02:10.969
and what they did is they did that for a

00:02:11.280 00:02:13.290
period of time and then they introduced

00:02:13.750 00:02:16.320
hawksin that creates Parkinson's and in

00:02:16.480 00:02:17.940
the mice that were treated with the

00:02:19.230 00:02:20.640
photobiomodulation Parkinson's disease

00:02:21.100 00:02:23.580
did not eventuate anywhere near the same

00:02:23.770 00:02:26.310
as if they were not treated I've got a

00:02:26.650 00:02:28.410
video on photobiomodulation that you can

00:02:28.600 00:02:30.090
take a look at here here's the link up

00:02:30.280 00:02:32.520
on the screen through here if you don't

00:02:32.710 00:02:33.510
know much about remote

00:02:34.000 00:02:35.280
photobiomodulation you're really

00:02:35.530 00:02:36.840
probably missing the boat because it's

00:02:37.300 00:02:39.120
likely going to be the key way that

00:02:40.000 00:02:41.790
photobiomodulation is proven to work in

00:02:42.340 00:02:44.010
the future it's not about just direct

00:02:44.260 00:02:45.840
that's important but it's also this

00:02:46.510 00:02:49.590
indirect or remote photobiomodulation so

00:02:49.780 00:02:51.270
we know that remote photobiomodulation

00:02:52.120 00:02:53.820
is a huge thing and you can apply this

00:02:54.520 00:02:56.100
in your day to day life if you are doing

00:02:56.440 00:02:58.230
simply things like near infrared saunas

00:02:58.420 00:03:00.680
on a regular basis you get full-body

00:03:01.980 00:03:03.600
photobiomodulation that in theory should

00:03:04.000 00:03:06.450
then have an effect on the brain time

00:03:06.640 00:03:08.220
will tell and more research obviously

00:03:08.470 00:03:10.800
needs to be done the second thing that's

00:03:11.080 00:03:13.380
new with with Parkinson's disease is we

00:03:13.690 00:03:16.230
found out that photobiomodulation again

00:03:16.390 00:03:18.960
in mice this is new research again I

00:03:19.090 00:03:20.820
think it's 2018 showed that

00:03:21.630 00:03:24.320
photobiomodulation again on the abdomen

00:03:25.330 00:03:28.140
increase the gut microbiome and when I

00:03:28.390 00:03:30.210
say increase the gut microbiome what it

00:03:30.550 00:03:34.800
did is it increase the good bacteria why

00:03:35.020 00:03:36.680
am I talking about photobiomodulation

00:03:37.690 00:03:38.880
increasing good bacteria when we're

00:03:39.010 00:03:40.560
doing a video on Parkinson's well it

00:03:40.840 00:03:43.320
turns out that if people have

00:03:44.050 00:03:46.740
Parkinson's they also have a altered

00:03:48.340 00:03:51.540
gut microbiome we know that if you've

00:03:51.700 00:03:54.270
got a bad microbiome that impacts the

00:03:54.550 00:03:56.370
brain health and vice versa so if we can

00:03:56.770 00:03:58.229
influence the microbiome with

00:03:58.690 00:04:00.180
photobiomodulation through the abdomen

00:04:00.730 00:04:02.790
that in turn should have a positive

00:04:03.100 00:04:04.800
effect on the parkinson's disease and

00:04:05.770 00:04:07.650
that we know to be true so there's some

00:04:08.080 00:04:10.170
great research that's just brand new

00:04:10.840 00:04:12.210
starting to look into this again just on

00:04:12.489 00:04:13.920
mice but if you are using

00:04:14.790 00:04:16.440
photobiomodulation why not get the

00:04:16.870 00:04:19.020
benefits perhaps of this increased

00:04:20.100 00:04:23.670
microbiome the third up-to-date finding

00:04:23.800 00:04:25.360
that I'd like to share about

00:04:26.320 00:04:30.180
human safety now photobiomodulation is

00:04:31.190 00:04:33.370
well-documented to have very very few

00:04:33.770 00:04:36.100
side effects but we simply haven't done

00:04:36.979 00:04:40.360
until recently long term studies too

00:04:40.639 00:04:42.189
which show how does a person respond

00:04:42.410 00:04:44.290
when you're using photobiomodulation for

00:04:44.479 00:04:47.350
a year or two years and some things have

00:04:47.600 00:04:49.689
now become clear where there is a case

00:04:49.729 00:04:52.030
study done of four patients they were on

00:04:52.370 00:04:54.670
the photobiomodulation i think twelve to

00:04:55.100 00:04:56.200
fourteen months something along those

00:04:56.360 00:04:58.990
lines there's another paper that i can

00:04:59.210 00:05:00.250
share with you at the bottom through

00:05:00.560 00:05:02.320
here that's new it was a letter to the

00:05:02.449 00:05:04.150
editor about a randomized controlled

00:05:04.490 00:05:06.129
study into parkinson's that showed that

00:05:06.410 00:05:07.480
they were able to use photobiomodulation

00:05:08.270 00:05:09.670
for a long period of time in humans with

00:05:09.860 00:05:11.560
no side effects and now they've done

00:05:12.020 00:05:13.960
studies into primates which again i have

00:05:14.120 00:05:15.939
the link below where they were not able

00:05:16.100 00:05:17.860
to find any problems with applying

00:05:18.410 00:05:19.719
photobiomodulation to the brain in

00:05:20.300 00:05:23.110
primates so human safety appears to also

00:05:23.479 00:05:26.279
be a really important development but

00:05:27.289 00:05:29.080
again just to qualify it it's not that

00:05:29.360 00:05:31.000
I'm saying that we know for sure that

00:05:31.160 00:05:32.770
it's safe it's saying that it's looking

00:05:32.930 00:05:34.690
like it's safe and more research will

00:05:35.060 00:05:37.839
still need to be done and the fourth

00:05:38.240 00:05:42.040
factor is that in this new randomized

00:05:42.500 00:05:43.740
control study that was done in Spain

00:05:44.750 00:05:46.629
they actually left the Parkinson's

00:05:47.090 00:05:48.909
patients on their dopamine medication

00:05:49.099 00:05:52.870
and still got benefits another of the

00:05:53.150 00:05:54.790
the four case studies that I mentioned

00:05:55.210 00:05:57.670
previously they also left their patients

00:05:57.830 00:06:00.040
on the dopamine medication wall applying

00:06:00.349 00:06:03.100
the photobiomodulation and got a lot of

00:06:03.590 00:06:06.339
positive benefits to tremor reduction to

00:06:06.650 00:06:08.379
gate to the ability to get up and get

00:06:08.599 00:06:10.450
moving there is a lot of benefits so

00:06:10.610 00:06:11.800
what we're starting to find is that you

00:06:12.020 00:06:15.640
can use photobiomodulation along with

00:06:15.949 00:06:17.800
the dopamine medication which would have

00:06:17.930 00:06:19.120
been an issue for a lot of people

00:06:19.400 00:06:20.589
because you would be asking the question

00:06:20.750 00:06:22.089
is it going to interact in a positive

00:06:22.729 00:06:24.670
way or a negative way can I do the two

00:06:24.860 00:06:27.820
together it is looking like we will be

00:06:27.979 00:06:29.860
able to use the two together so that

00:06:30.139 00:06:31.570
people don't have to worry about out

00:06:32.060 00:06:34.180
aspect through there so with all of that

00:06:34.520 00:06:35.649
being said those are the newer

00:06:36.440 00:06:37.510
developments that we know we still don't

00:06:37.669 00:06:38.770
know exactly the right

00:06:38.930 00:06:40.930
dose we don't know exactly the best

00:06:41.090 00:06:43.120
place to apply it we're still sorting

00:06:43.220 00:06:45.040
out all these different things if you

00:06:45.320 00:06:47.409
have Parkinson's though the question

00:06:47.570 00:06:49.870
you'll be asking yourself is what should

00:06:50.000 00:06:52.659
I do now the guy in the ABC video took

00:06:52.940 00:06:54.550
it upon himself and he created his own

00:06:54.860 00:06:56.200
little helmet and he started applying it

00:06:56.300 00:06:57.460
a couple times a day and he's been

00:06:57.560 00:06:59.530
getting great results how would an

00:06:59.720 00:07:00.879
average person be able to access

00:07:01.730 00:07:03.190
near-infrared lights and be able to

00:07:03.620 00:07:05.710
perhaps use it on themselves that's

00:07:05.990 00:07:07.720
where there are devices available out

00:07:07.760 00:07:10.180
there that people can purchase such as

00:07:11.000 00:07:14.860
this device here this is a near infrared

00:07:15.320 00:07:18.159
lamp it's got two LED lights well it's

00:07:18.290 00:07:20.020
got 12 LED lights in it but they're

00:07:20.240 00:07:22.180
tuned to two different frequencies one

00:07:22.340 00:07:23.800
is tuned into red light which you can

00:07:24.140 00:07:26.020
clearly see in the video that's 660

00:07:26.600 00:07:27.700
nanometers and the other is a

00:07:28.190 00:07:29.800
near-infrared light tune in to 850

00:07:30.460 00:07:32.800
nanometers we sell this unit because you

00:07:32.960 00:07:34.870
can use this unit on anything for

00:07:35.530 00:07:37.060
photobiomodulation so if you've got

00:07:37.760 00:07:39.070
shoulder pain you could use it to treat

00:07:39.229 00:07:41.560
the shoulder if you've got depression a

00:07:41.780 00:07:42.969
lot of the research is showing in you

00:07:43.130 00:07:45.130
can use it for depression even some of

00:07:45.200 00:07:46.719
the new research is showing that you can

00:07:46.970 00:07:49.450
use it for just increasing cognitive

00:07:49.880 00:07:52.030
performance in normal people they're

00:07:52.370 00:07:53.560
applying the light to the head and

00:07:53.750 00:07:54.580
they're finding that there can be

00:07:55.190 00:07:57.480
increased cognition depression anxiety

00:07:58.490 00:07:59.950
performance with sports skin health

00:08:00.560 00:08:02.230
that's a huge thing to try to reduce

00:08:02.780 00:08:04.450
wrinkles but the point I'm making is if

00:08:04.550 00:08:07.029
you have one of these lamps it would be

00:08:07.160 00:08:09.490
up to you but you could use it on your

00:08:09.740 00:08:10.840
head just like they've done in these

00:08:11.120 00:08:12.909
sort of case studies and some of the

00:08:13.220 00:08:15.310
early research and what it would appear

00:08:15.470 00:08:16.480
that they're doing is they would shine

00:08:16.640 00:08:19.570
it on the temples primarily for a period

00:08:19.700 00:08:20.800
of time and that would be up to you to

00:08:21.110 00:08:22.120
sort of soar through what you would want

00:08:22.280 00:08:23.770
to do but you would just shine it on the

00:08:24.110 00:08:26.050
temple here possibly on the forehead and

00:08:26.150 00:08:28.090
then on the other temple and then the

00:08:28.460 00:08:29.920
research in Spain what they were doing

00:08:30.050 00:08:32.170
is shining it on the temples for one

00:08:32.479 00:08:33.579
minute on one side and then a minute

00:08:34.010 00:08:35.620
here for a total of six minutes and that

00:08:35.750 00:08:36.100
was it

00:08:36.200 00:08:37.570
and they were getting some pretty good

00:08:37.849 00:08:39.430
results in that randomized control study

00:08:39.800 00:08:42.640
that I was sharing with you earlier it's

00:08:42.830 00:08:44.260
up to you to decide how you want to use

00:08:44.600 00:08:45.850
the information that's out there and I'm

00:08:46.190 00:08:48.010
simply sharing it with you but there are

00:08:48.620 00:08:49.990
ways to get a hold of near-infrared

00:08:50.360 00:08:52.170
lights if you are looking for them

00:08:52.360 00:08:54.000
this is one way to go about doing it if

00:08:54.130 00:08:55.140
you're interested in these sorts of

00:08:55.360 00:08:56.490
lights you can jump onto our website

00:08:57.190 00:08:59.280
their retail with shipping for a hundred

00:08:59.380 00:09:01.230
and fifty dollars they're not overly

00:09:01.690 00:09:03.750
expensive and then you've got the light

00:09:03.910 00:09:05.010
at home you can use it for whatever

00:09:05.620 00:09:07.200
happens if you get an injury or a wound

00:09:07.660 00:09:09.510
or whatever it is you'll at least have

00:09:09.970 00:09:11.190
access to the light to be able to speed

00:09:11.230 00:09:13.440
up that healing so there you go that's

00:09:13.600 00:09:17.520
my update on Parkinson's for 2019 I will

00:09:17.680 00:09:19.110
be looking to do a couple more updates

00:09:19.600 00:09:21.120
perhaps on Alzheimer's in the future I

00:09:22.000 00:09:23.070
always have more information on

00:09:23.560 00:09:24.900
photobiomodulation I try to publish a

00:09:25.120 00:09:26.460
new video every couple of weeks or so

00:09:27.250 00:09:28.710
make sure you subscribe to our YouTube

00:09:28.750 00:09:30.210
