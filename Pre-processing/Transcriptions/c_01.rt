00:01:33.810 00:01:36.440
crafty life in general although I've got

00:01:36.600 00:01:38.149
no other craft to show you today other

00:01:38.189 00:01:43.880
than knitting so last week I introduced

00:01:44.280 00:01:46.969
my new section the shrug with the truck

00:01:47.430 00:01:47.960
sorry about that

00:01:48.509 00:01:50.179
the shrug with the truck no the truck

00:01:50.369 00:01:52.999
with the truck which was full of my

00:01:53.909 00:01:56.870
whips and I have to hold my hands up and

00:01:57.469 00:02:00.499
say that truck has not moved from where

00:02:00.570 00:02:05.120
I put it down last week and I don't know

00:02:06.350 00:02:08.419
why well I dunno why just because I

00:02:08.579 00:02:11.319
haven't I've been really busy and

00:02:12.329 00:02:14.780
casting on new things that haven't made

00:02:14.940 00:02:18.319
it into the truth this work so let's get

00:02:18.720 00:02:22.550
into fours finished objects and I have

00:02:23.010 00:02:25.530
one new finished object

00:02:25.629 00:02:28.229
and an old finished object then I'm

00:02:28.420 00:02:30.720
going to show you and because I can't

00:02:31.090 00:02:32.849
remember if I showed it or not so that

00:02:33.159 00:02:36.149
will just make a brief appearance but my

00:02:36.519 00:02:40.250
main finished object Oh new socks and

00:02:41.260 00:02:45.300
these are the fragment socks by Helen

00:02:48.780 00:02:54.449
Stewart in my mum OG colorway on a 75

00:02:54.670 00:02:56.789
percent wool for at 25 percent nylon

00:02:57.549 00:03:01.229
base and look knitting these absolutely

00:03:01.840 00:03:05.339
love knitting these and I didn't do the

00:03:06.159 00:03:09.509
chevron design on the foot and but I did

00:03:10.120 00:03:13.559
continue reading and I did a fish lips

00:03:13.900 00:03:20.039
kiss heel heel um completely different

00:03:20.200 00:03:22.619
three on I'm high it's very rare I

00:03:23.290 00:03:26.339
nicked a rib on a sock unless for people

00:03:26.590 00:03:29.610
spend ami soon by a man and I always use

00:03:29.889 00:03:33.390
my twisted cast on and I always knit a

00:03:33.729 00:03:37.680
got a heel flap with a garter tab at the

00:03:37.989 00:03:41.030
edge and I always finish with start off

00:03:42.040 00:03:43.409
so this one's got two different methods

00:03:43.540 00:03:46.890
for me it's got the rib it's got the

00:03:47.109 00:03:48.599
fish lips kiss heel and I've done a

00:03:49.389 00:03:52.649
standard and decrease either side and

00:03:53.349 00:03:56.610
then a kitchenette and the taupe

00:03:57.370 00:03:59.490
stitches so really thoroughly enjoyed

00:04:00.010 00:04:02.939
knitting these these the design is by

00:04:03.370 00:04:05.580
Helen Stewart curious handmade designs

00:04:06.120 00:04:08.969
and and the patent is available in the

00:04:09.400 00:04:12.559
lane magazine Lane Lane Lane Lane

00:04:13.569 00:04:16.920
magazine issue fall I think it's number

00:04:17.260 00:04:21.390
four well it's the last one they did but

00:04:21.549 00:04:23.159
yeah lovely and I'm just looking at them

00:04:23.349 00:04:25.230
thinking I'm sure ones slightly shorter

00:04:25.449 00:04:31.580
than the other buckle just like death

00:04:32.590 00:04:35.879
but no love it so yeah so that's them

00:04:36.279 00:04:38.969
and the other one is just a plain

00:04:39.879 00:04:42.300
for me which is in my it started with a

00:04:42.930 00:04:45.480
kiss colorway which I will show you this

00:04:45.759 00:04:48.749
in a skin and when I get around to night

00:04:48.939 00:04:53.129
shop update so I've been really good

00:04:53.319 00:04:57.119
with mine it's this week I have cast on

00:04:57.370 00:04:58.740
more new thing but that just that was

00:04:58.780 00:05:02.580
just socks and I'm just testing some out

00:05:03.009 00:05:06.240
for my Christmas kits that after doing

00:05:06.340 00:05:08.219
then I've got some new wool which I've

00:05:08.379 00:05:10.350
just been dying up trying out a

00:05:10.780 00:05:13.890
different blend from a different meal

00:05:14.800 00:05:16.820
which is really lovely

00:05:17.830 00:05:21.930
so am I thought I start now with works

00:05:22.240 00:05:28.140
in progress got new solo custody I loved

00:05:28.419 00:05:29.730
them when I bought them but when they

00:05:29.889 00:05:31.950
come today my daughter said they look

00:05:32.080 00:05:34.230
like something out of a rest home and

00:05:34.539 00:05:35.909
all people talk and I'm inclined to

00:05:36.159 00:05:38.279
agree with that honey who's usually them

00:05:38.469 00:05:41.640
up and what I thought they were charcoal

00:05:41.949 00:05:44.339
gray when I ordered them but they're not

00:05:44.860 00:05:48.149
that a false blue that like a deep navy

00:05:49.139 00:05:51.360
blue they're taken some getting used to

00:05:51.819 00:05:54.420
because they are and my on their sofas

00:05:54.580 00:05:56.850
were really slouchy and what I mean I

00:05:56.979 00:05:58.350
had problem getting out of it so this

00:05:58.509 00:05:59.640
one I've gone for like this it often

00:05:59.860 00:06:02.459
bakes all that great an it in position

00:06:02.949 00:06:05.040
that's it look that bit of it and once I

00:06:05.169 00:06:06.300
can get past the aesthetics of it

00:06:06.580 00:06:09.809
looking a bit like you know a nursing

00:06:11.819 00:06:15.510
home Lucy said she was I think about is

00:06:15.759 00:06:19.230
not over I'll delete that bit cheeky

00:06:20.009 00:06:21.899
bugger but I like because they're both

00:06:22.180 00:06:24.360
the set is recline and me chair reclines

00:06:25.029 00:06:26.519
it's a grand knitting chair in fact when

00:06:26.620 00:06:28.829
we husband got on the chair and he

00:06:29.409 00:06:30.480
reclined at least are born like this

00:06:31.150 00:06:32.309
that's what you do me some just chance

00:06:32.469 00:06:39.089
alright for you in the Injil anyway this

00:06:39.310 00:06:42.050
is me can't what I've been working on

00:06:43.060 00:06:46.589
absolutely love love this it is by

00:06:47.259 00:06:50.760
scheme to your necks and I won't even

00:06:52.000 00:06:59.370
you pronounce it but it is that that's

00:06:59.740 00:07:01.950
le modeling it I think oh yeah I know it

00:07:04.720 00:07:07.620
so I've done it but the only moderation

00:07:07.690 00:07:09.600
I have done and it's not you know at the

00:07:09.820 00:07:14.010
norm is and I love the confetti jump our

00:07:14.170 00:07:16.200
own name because I love the airline that

00:07:16.480 00:07:17.910
works great with the majority new

00:07:18.520 00:07:22.530
wardrobes you know and try it long I let

00:07:22.930 00:07:24.780
linen chick dresses and stuff like that

00:07:24.970 00:07:25.800
so I thought rather than have a

00:07:26.530 00:07:28.770
waistband that might bring us in that

00:07:28.870 00:07:32.280
the week in it brings in and and that

00:07:32.500 00:07:34.170
love you good luck on me I thought I'll

00:07:34.240 00:07:39.030
just do it slightly ear lane so I did I

00:07:39.400 00:07:42.210
have done this so far and I hadn't it

00:07:42.460 00:07:45.660
half a sleeve now when I started off

00:07:45.970 00:07:48.180
along size and then I decided I was

00:07:48.340 00:07:50.490
gonna go for the the bigger size I hope

00:07:50.710 00:07:55.280
to god it's a massive forest and and

00:07:56.290 00:07:59.130
without thinking you know I just plod on

00:07:59.650 00:08:01.770
and when I've got to the sleeves and

00:08:01.870 00:08:04.140
then it half-ass least are huge on it

00:08:04.420 00:08:06.470
well huge on it so what I'm gonna do is

00:08:07.480 00:08:09.840
between these big excuse me you have to

00:08:10.030 00:08:14.580
pick up 18 stitches I think I'm gonna

00:08:15.100 00:08:19.409
bring it in and just do nine and try and

00:08:19.570 00:08:21.150
bring it in that just underneath the arm

00:08:22.150 00:08:23.430
we'll see what it looks like

00:08:23.950 00:08:26.940
you know if it's a bit messy and don't

00:08:27.070 00:08:28.860
miss me armpits nobody but me is gonna

00:08:29.110 00:08:30.630
know unless I start like you know doing

00:08:30.669 00:08:33.570
the Mexican wave and but I love it and

00:08:33.760 00:08:40.830
I'm Nick Nick in the phenol phenol pink

00:08:41.080 00:08:44.159
tea tube that I bought when at the youth

00:08:44.530 00:08:47.640
under Teague stand and at Umbreon

00:08:48.270 00:08:49.890
festival which was really good

00:08:50.470 00:08:51.540
knowledge I said I didn't think it well

00:08:51.670 00:08:52.980
it seemed disappoint me because it'll

00:08:53.170 00:08:56.420
come in handy when I bought the war I

00:08:57.430 00:08:58.980
was a bit unsure about the mixture what

00:08:59.230 00:09:02.030
half yet so the lady who served me

00:09:03.040 00:09:05.730
looked at the pattern and

00:09:06.340 00:09:09.560
recommended by two balls each of the :

00:09:10.570 00:09:12.630
contrasting color now then that's what

00:09:12.760 00:09:16.740
I've got left out the first ball and so

00:09:16.900 00:09:19.590
I've got two full balls of one each of

00:09:19.750 00:09:24.360
these shades and and I think I think I

00:09:24.580 00:09:27.740
might have quite a bit left of the

00:09:28.750 00:09:32.810
brown-eyed me me in color but you know

00:09:33.820 00:09:35.100
that could be a few hats and a few

00:09:35.530 00:09:39.930
minutes and on that recomendation excuse

00:09:40.090 00:09:41.610
me and that recommendation I've got

00:09:41.980 00:09:47.100
someone for another jump F and I think

00:09:47.320 00:09:49.590
that were fairly confident of overbought

00:09:50.160 00:09:56.220
on that so and I would think I'm mitten

00:09:56.410 00:09:58.920
I'm gonna knit cardigan and Zelda's

00:09:59.710 00:10:00.870
cardigan I can't even remember what it's

00:10:00.970 00:10:06.330
called now cuz I can remember seeing it

00:10:06.400 00:10:07.530
and I thought one pronounced in that

00:10:09.210 00:10:12.180
room it's not a it's not a little it's a

00:10:12.460 00:10:14.610
long one in a long ish one bit like a

00:10:15.160 00:10:17.130
granddad cardigan but it's lovely you

00:10:17.320 00:10:19.380
know and the other one is in pale gray

00:10:20.020 00:10:23.400
so that would be a good a good stash

00:10:24.220 00:10:26.880
yarn for half spare so yeah but I love

00:10:27.220 00:10:30.960
this absolutely loved it when I was

00:10:31.270 00:10:32.640
choosing this wall though I was standing

00:10:32.920 00:10:36.780
talking with a lady and and were like

00:10:36.970 00:10:38.400
just what colors were like like another

00:10:38.890 00:10:41.700
customer oh no Mama sexy no I'm gonna go

00:10:41.830 00:10:43.440
for nachos go financial father brother

00:10:44.010 00:10:46.230
and and she's all I think you should go

00:10:46.390 00:10:47.970
for brights and a mic no no no no no

00:10:48.400 00:10:49.860
what not drawn somewhat happier and then

00:10:49.990 00:10:51.780
when I saw Ali at their own well more at

00:10:51.880 00:10:53.880
the midnight I can reinvest what I said

00:10:54.010 00:10:55.710
I went for a nap trolls what-have-you

00:10:55.960 00:10:57.900
and she still said well I think you

00:10:58.090 00:11:01.110
should have gone for brights and you

00:11:01.240 00:11:03.030
know there's a bit of that kick on going

00:11:03.280 00:11:05.040
through humane thing and which had gone

00:11:05.320 00:11:08.820
for the brains now you know not just

00:11:08.980 00:11:10.680
like because I think the contrast

00:11:10.930 00:11:14.160
between these two isn't great cleaning I

00:11:14.950 00:11:16.590
still know that and when I called

00:11:16.960 00:11:19.290
Edinburgh next yeah I can just get right

00:11:19.930 00:11:23.340
or I can just order online they flap

00:11:23.650 00:11:26.640
that one and there's loose now have this

00:11:26.980 00:11:29.750
throw what happens Christmas in my back

00:11:30.760 00:11:34.590

working on well actually yes it is all

00:17:32.679 00:17:35.249
I've got on my needles and I'm desperate

00:17:35.289 00:17:37.109
to cast something you all know I bought

00:17:37.869 00:17:41.129
when I was away in Edinburgh bought a

00:17:41.789 00:17:48.529
kit to do the blink blink yes by loop

00:17:49.539 00:17:50.940
now that was I don't know if I told you

00:17:52.049 00:17:54.889
in one of my podcast was oh that one

00:17:55.899 00:17:56.970
don't even I have sport much about

00:17:57.279 00:17:58.200
everybody on Fester

00:17:58.780 00:18:02.490
anyway I was really smug on the Friday

00:18:03.280 00:18:04.530
because I bought everything on the

00:18:05.200 00:18:07.650
Thursday I was really smug because all I

00:18:08.020 00:18:11.580
bought on the Thursday it was my two

00:18:11.830 00:18:14.130
pair of ready knit socks from Barham you

00:18:14.350 00:18:18.960

he's had them on a few times have washed

00:18:20.770 00:18:23.430
up great so I think now I'll just buy in

00:18:23.620 00:18:25.260
them rather than the me pair and the

00:18:25.450 00:18:27.990
only reason I discovered these was I'm

00:18:28.270 00:18:29.580
sitting next to Tracy comes across two

00:18:29.800 00:18:31.230
girls and she bought up a splinter pair

00:18:31.540 00:18:33.570
and I thought myself today I'm gonna get

00:18:33.820 00:18:35.730
them so I've got them anyway it's our

00:18:36.010 00:18:38.210
sin us feel really really smug and

00:18:39.220 00:18:40.530
because on the Friday out was more I was

00:18:41.110 00:18:42.570
socializing more than shopping just

00:18:43.000 00:18:44.880
because you know I didn't day for the

00:18:45.100 00:18:49.350

people that I knew and what have you and

00:18:55.330 00:18:58.680

00:18:58.900 00:19:00.960
stealing together and as we were walking

00:19:01.300 00:19:04.040

00:19:29.800 00:19:31.080

00:19:32.290 00:19:33.390
so she said come on me I'll go and have

00:19:33.460 00:19:36.270

00:19:36.550 00:19:38.940
haven't got that well I am good but

00:19:39.190 00:19:41.250
sometimes new willpower deserts me I

00:19:41.380 00:19:43.580
think I left it in its which at weekend

00:19:44.590 00:19:45.240

00:19:45.340 00:19:46.470
well like in an how do look I'm not

00:19:46.630 00:19:49.160
happy they have a couple there so and

00:19:50.170 00:19:51.300
there are two girls and stuff we'll try

00:19:51.460 00:19:53.550
them on you know and I never normally

00:19:53.860 00:19:55.290
like to try things on cuz I think I'm

00:19:55.630 00:19:58.650

00:19:59.170 00:20:00.270
one on and she looked absolutely

00:20:01.000 00:20:03.720
gorgeous in it and I thought oh well

00:20:06.040 00:20:12.630

00:20:18.580 00:20:20.400
I'm gonna get this one an asset alright

00:20:20.560 00:20:26.220
now have the pink okay back on the board

00:20:26.410 00:20:29.220
had these kids but they I saw lovely and

00:20:30.070 00:20:33.780
and one is and a linen you it's listen

00:20:34.240 00:20:39.090
linen and there is a more hair silk I

00:20:39.550 00:20:40.830
think and you knit them two strands

00:20:40.990 00:20:43.250
together or can't we look at that on

00:20:44.260 00:20:46.830
it's just it's right up my street but I

00:20:47.110 00:20:48.540
can't be so I'll show that on the next

00:20:48.790 00:20:52.350
one so that's what I want to M cast all

00:20:52.990 00:20:56.340
but I'm being really really good so I

00:20:56.410 00:20:57.930
think that's quite good isn't it just

00:20:58.270 00:21:01.830
happen three projects on the core well

00:21:02.050 00:21:08.060
that I'm you know octave on um so

00:21:09.690 00:21:12.000
purchases well I haven't got any

00:21:12.670 00:21:13.890
purchases I'm usually quite good just

00:21:14.320 00:21:20.460
well with that bit sad am I usually meet

00:21:21.010 00:21:26.600
most of my purchases from and festivals

00:21:30.130 00:21:33.260
you know all yeah I do I save up and I

00:21:34.270 00:21:35.610
splurge and buy when I'm at a festival

00:21:36.490 00:21:37.680
so much

00:21:37.720 00:21:39.900
I will I have got some leaders coming

00:21:40.210 00:21:44.540
from meadow yarn which is local to me

00:21:45.550 00:21:48.900
just some high high app short once not

00:21:49.030 00:21:49.530
the time

00:21:49.570 00:21:51.720
I think the forty cent meet that's just

00:21:51.850 00:21:55.230
an it seems so the other thing I thought

00:21:55.630 00:21:58.890
is me stash enhancement I bought this in

00:21:59.590 00:22:01.350
the summer so that's really bad isn't it

00:22:01.540 00:22:06.120
and I bought it to go to neat color work

00:22:06.790 00:22:09.780
from drops but when I download the

00:22:10.480 00:22:14.220
oh my goodness those pants you know and

00:22:14.410 00:22:17.600
I think I'm a fairly experienced knitter

00:22:18.610 00:22:21.610
but sometimes I was a bit baffled

00:22:21.679 00:22:25.930
by this pattern um it was a case of I

00:22:26.090 00:22:28.779
was having to do too much research on

00:22:28.940 00:22:31.299
the pattern for me to enjoy it so I put

00:22:31.640 00:22:33.610
that on the back burner but I'd already

00:22:34.010 00:22:35.649
bought the wall and because I couldn't

00:22:35.840 00:22:37.480
make the mind of some of the colors I

00:22:37.640 00:22:39.430
bought the selection of colas and I'm

00:22:39.620 00:22:43.659
gonna knit Matilda a jumper and I'll

00:22:43.909 00:22:48.430
probably litter a color work from the

00:22:48.980 00:22:50.980
heart on your sleeve which is a book

00:22:51.620 00:22:55.630
fronting annex that was published to

00:22:55.789 00:22:59.320
raise money for mosquito nets I think

00:23:01.210 00:23:04.980
for malaria I might have got that right

00:23:07.059 00:23:11.310
it's fairly loose description but and

00:23:12.320 00:23:13.810
the pans are all double it unless I'm

00:23:13.940 00:23:15.820
working on the theory what am I Juiz and

00:23:16.460 00:23:19.169
Kuzma told us to I might go up to her

00:23:20.179 00:23:23.350
there was a statue before or a 68 I'm

00:23:23.539 00:23:26.380
going to go up to the six to eight but

00:23:26.510 00:23:28.120
I'm going to write down the needle size

00:23:28.190 00:23:30.039
to probably three so that's got to take

00:23:30.409 00:23:33.930
the edge and these are the colors that

00:23:34.940 00:23:37.360
it's the softest of lilac with turquoise

00:23:37.730 00:23:40.860
and then like they're corally pink and

00:23:41.870 00:23:45.010
then I've also got the cream in a deep

00:23:45.380 00:23:52.779
Heather color you know so so I think

00:23:53.179 00:23:54.940
I'll knit her something up with this and

00:23:54.980 00:23:57.519
I have got enough oops

00:23:58.100 00:23:59.799
well actually I have got enough to knit

00:24:00.020 00:24:01.169
me a jump

00:24:02.179 00:24:03.970
so I might have a rethink on that

00:24:04.159 00:24:06.149
because it seems too shameful to use

00:24:07.159 00:24:08.620
like two boards up so then I'll have

00:24:08.840 00:24:10.419
about five boards that I can't really do

00:24:10.460 00:24:13.120
much with but that is a lovely buttery

00:24:14.080 00:24:18.279
yellow and that is the drops alpaca and

00:24:19.100 00:24:20.950
now I've got a little drop see on before

00:24:22.390 00:24:24.909
and but you see them a lot at the shore

00:24:24.950 00:24:26.590
store then there's also a massive queue

00:24:26.779 00:24:28.149
it's like it's a bun fight isn't it

00:24:28.370 00:24:29.350
trying to get on that stall so I've

00:24:29.600 00:24:32.680
never really and knit with it but it

00:24:32.960 00:24:34.880
feels lovely and I bought it from

00:24:34.980 00:24:39.770
and a shop of North that I and there's

00:24:39.929 00:24:42.620

want and more really and it's just

00:25:15.750 00:25:17.390

00:29:01.159 00:29:02.530
of everything in that

00:29:03.230 00:29:08.520
