00:00:04.440 00:00:06.260
hello again I thought I'd start my first

00:00:06.629 00:00:08.839
science video on something I know pretty

00:00:08.970 00:00:11.000
well the brain I'm going to be talking

00:00:11.160 00:00:13.940
about some neuroscience today you recite

00:00:14.130 00:00:15.320
your aside today I'm gonna be talking

00:00:15.630 00:00:17.599
about that if that's okay I think it is

00:00:17.850 00:00:19.820
yeah I think it's great let's go let's

00:00:20.039 00:00:21.470
go on your science so I'll start with

00:00:21.630 00:00:23.480
the simple fact that your whole body is

00:00:24.029 00:00:26.720
made up of cells your skin your hair

00:00:26.910 00:00:28.820
your eyes get tons it's all made of

00:00:29.039 00:00:31.490
cells including your brain your brain is

00:00:31.710 00:00:34.010
also made up of cells when some of these

00:00:34.320 00:00:37.400
brain cells also known as neurons die

00:00:37.829 00:00:40.130
that's called neuro degeneration neuro

00:00:40.680 00:00:43.250
like brain and degeneration like wearing

00:00:43.469 00:00:45.380
away different parts of your brain have

00:00:45.809 00:00:47.330
different jobs so depending on where

00:00:47.579 00:00:49.880
these brain cells die different effects

00:00:50.010 00:00:51.680
of see therefore there are numerous

00:00:52.320 00:00:54.020
different neurodegenerative disorders

00:00:54.239 00:00:55.520
you wanna spin my wheel of neuro

00:00:56.280 00:01:04.810
degeneration and see what we get today

00:01:05.900 00:01:08.420
ding Parkinson's disease so Parkinson's

00:01:08.790 00:01:09.500
disease is one of these

00:01:10.380 00:01:11.510
neurodegenerative diseases today I'm

00:01:11.700 00:01:13.190
going to explain in how it works

00:01:13.409 00:01:14.690
the main symptom of Parkinson's disease

00:01:15.210 00:01:17.570
is difficulty with movements sometimes

00:01:18.420 00:01:20.990
complete rigidity sometimes shaking to

00:01:21.390 00:01:22.640
understand what causes Parkinson's

00:01:23.040 00:01:25.550
disease we must ask ourselves what is a

00:01:26.009 00:01:28.810
movement I've enlisted the help of

00:01:29.820 00:01:32.030
myself to help explain what causes

00:01:32.820 00:01:34.249
Parkinson's the first question to

00:01:34.380 00:01:37.609
address is what is a movement me moving

00:01:37.650 00:01:39.950
my arm isn't as simple as my brain

00:01:40.530 00:01:42.230
sending a signal to my arm muscle and my

00:01:42.450 00:01:44.450
arm muscle moving a key part of any

00:01:44.729 00:01:46.460
movement is you wanting to move

00:01:47.310 00:01:48.980
otherwise your brain could send signals

00:01:49.320 00:01:50.660
willy-nilly and your arm could just keep

00:01:51.119 00:01:52.370
moving and I could be like holding a

00:01:52.560 00:01:54.950
glass of water and then it could just be

00:01:58.570 00:02:01.080
sike no you've got to want to move and

00:02:01.330 00:02:03.780
this intention to move this want to move

00:02:04.300 00:02:05.910
is controlled by a chemical called

00:02:06.960 00:02:09.719
dopamine science words dopamine is

00:02:10.149 00:02:10.830
designs we're ready

00:02:11.200 00:02:13.230
alright so dopamine is a chemical and

00:02:13.690 00:02:15.630
also a science word but how does it

00:02:15.670 00:02:18.150
actually control our movements and what

00:02:18.280 00:02:20.550
you're about to see my old high school

00:02:21.190 00:02:24.030
locker keys represent dopamine so

00:02:24.280 00:02:25.560
whenever I don't want to move my arm

00:02:26.470 00:02:28.980
consider it locked in place then I think

00:02:29.610 00:02:32.850
oh I want to move my arm and as if by

00:02:35.650 00:02:37.800
dopamine appears and allows me to unlock

00:02:38.020 00:02:43.020
my arm so it can move doctor doctor

00:02:43.870 00:02:46.949
doctor doctor good hurt thank you

00:02:47.830 00:02:49.979
dopamine so dopamine acts as the key

00:02:50.410 00:02:52.080
that unlocks my arm and enables it to

00:02:52.420 00:02:54.510
move when I want it to but what does

00:02:55.060 00:02:56.640
dopamine's unlocking of movements have

00:02:56.800 00:02:58.260
to do with the cause of Parkinson's

00:02:58.800 00:03:01.229
disease this dopamine is released by

00:03:01.299 00:03:03.750
neurons in your brain in Parkinson's

00:03:03.820 00:03:06.539
disease these neurons start to die which

00:03:06.580 00:03:09.229
means less dopamine released which means

00:03:10.239 00:03:12.509
no keys to unlock that movement this

00:03:13.060 00:03:15.000
neuron death is mainly focused in an

00:03:15.459 00:03:17.400
area of your brain called the substantia

00:03:18.400 00:03:19.320
 another science word at

00:03:20.080 00:03:22.140
substantial Niagra this can explain many

00:03:22.660 00:03:24.690
symptoms of Parkinson's rigidity because

00:03:25.000 00:03:26.759
you can't unlock your movements even

00:03:27.070 00:03:28.890
shaking because this represents your

00:03:29.200 00:03:30.990
sort of battle trying to get your arm to

00:03:31.180 00:03:32.400
move but it can't because it's not

00:03:32.769 00:03:34.800
unlocked by dopamine yet and that is how

00:03:34.870 00:03:36.539
the symptoms of Parkinson's are caused

00:03:37.390 00:03:38.940
I'm gonna go sit back on my bed now so

00:03:39.370 00:03:40.890
that's the general gist of what causes

00:03:41.709 00:03:43.199
Parkinson's disease Parkinson's and

00:03:43.630 00:03:45.330
neuro degeneration as a whole is a very

00:03:45.549 00:03:47.220
broad topic that's why I've got a whole

00:03:47.590 00:03:49.860
wheel of neuro degeneration here and so

00:03:50.200 00:03:51.720
I'm sure I'll get back onto it again

00:03:52.150 00:03:53.250
maybe I'll give you a cheeky little

00:03:53.560 00:03:55.110
rundown of what my dissertation was on

00:03:55.360 00:03:57.539
if you're lucky but thanks so much for

00:03:57.670 00:03:59.550
watching don't forget my Twitter and my

00:03:59.650 00:04:01.650
blog still exists so give them a look if

00:04:01.780 00:04:03.930
you want and remember keep asking

00:04:05.069 00:04:06.199
and here's a summary of what I've been

00:04:06.569 00:04:08.330
talking about give it a pause give it a

00:04:08.550 00:04:09.740
read if there's anything you don't quite

00:04:09.989 00:04:11.720
get or any further questions feel free

00:04:12.000 00:04:14.869
to pop them in the comments below we're

00:04:26.600 00:04:33.980
through every time dopamine appears and

00:04:34.320 00:04:37.040
smacked you in the head to be fair that

00:04:37.200 00:04:40.000
was accurate because it is in your brain
