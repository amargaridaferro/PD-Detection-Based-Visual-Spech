hi guys welcome to the second video in

00:00:04.140 00:00:05.570
my living with Parkinson's disease

00:00:06.620 00:00:09.169
series it wasn't until I started editing

00:00:09.660 00:00:11.450
and reviewing these videos that I got it

00:00:11.790 00:00:13.520
true glimpse of what my face actually

00:00:14.009 00:00:15.950
looks like to the outside world

00:00:15.990 00:00:18.380
a lot of what you will see here may look

00:00:18.750 00:00:21.650
like frown annoying 10 sadness but it's

00:00:21.990 00:00:23.210
actually due to a condition called

00:00:24.529 00:00:26.720
hypomania hypomania is very common in

00:00:26.970 00:00:28.820
Parkinson's disease and it causes an

00:00:29.279 00:00:31.840
impairment in facial expression

00:00:32.930 00:00:35.630
expressions so while some of what I talk

00:00:35.760 00:00:38.959
about is quite serious I'm not actually

00:00:39.329 00:00:43.870
as depressed as I look

00:00:57.680 00:00:59.529
Parkinson's disease affects people in

00:00:59.930 00:01:05.920
many different ways I have for the last

00:01:06.200 00:01:08.700
five years my symptoms have gone from

00:01:09.710 00:01:12.180

00:01:26.420 00:01:28.980
impairment posture and gait changes a

00:01:29.990 00:01:32.100
whole host of them but I will talk about

00:01:33.110 00:01:36.190
reveal the top three or four that impact

00:01:36.380 00:01:43.240
my daily life the channels are one of

00:01:43.340 00:01:45.999
the most difficult symptoms for me to to

00:01:46.690 00:01:51.120
handle it presents itself publicly and

00:01:52.130 00:01:54.940
it gets worse with any heightened

00:01:55.960 00:01:58.570
emotional fear anxiety happiness joy

00:01:59.080 00:02:02.559
sadness anything and it's because it's

00:02:02.750 00:02:04.510
such a public thing that I have to deal

00:02:08.649 00:02:12.560
I find it very challenging

00:02:15.830 00:02:17.350
my handwriting has been so badly

00:02:18.670 00:02:20.530
impacted you could barely see what I

00:02:21.700 00:02:24.309
write and it's hard because I have young

00:02:24.349 00:02:27.100
kids or I have to do have to tease with

00:02:27.379 00:02:28.990
and I have to sign their homework books

00:02:29.900 00:02:32.759
and they want me to do this with them I

00:02:33.769 00:02:36.399
can't tie my shoelaces properly or twice

00:02:36.799 00:02:40.750
my children I can't button up my sweater

00:02:42.849 00:02:46.030
I can't do my daughter's hair two weeks

00:02:46.340 00:02:51.000
ago I had to take out her braids

00:02:52.010 00:02:56.410
Washington conditioned to hair and it

00:02:56.569 00:02:58.550
took us ten hours to do that

00:03:03.110 00:03:04.540
and I feel bad

00:03:14.870 00:03:21.100
so it's hard to deal with
