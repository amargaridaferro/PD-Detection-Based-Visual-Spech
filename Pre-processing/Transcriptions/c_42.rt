00:00:00.390 00:00:01.130
welcome back to the gentleman's Gazette

00:00:01.589 00:00:03.320
and perd three of our mini-series on

00:00:03.959 00:00:05.660
colognes and fragrances if you haven't

00:00:05.730 00:00:07.190
already done so check out part 1 about

00:00:07.379 00:00:09.919
the history of Cologne and part 2 about

00:00:10.170 00:00:11.930
how to choose right cologne for you and

00:00:12.570 00:00:19.609
how to apply it first of all what the

00:00:20.010 00:00:22.189
dues of wearing Cologne 1 do testy

00:00:22.680 00:00:24.200
intensity of your Cologne before wearing

00:00:24.359 00:00:26.179
it in public you can do so at home

00:00:27.090 00:00:28.759
because some colognes are very

00:00:29.279 00:00:30.679
overpowering while others are very light

00:00:30.990 00:00:33.110
and you want something that is balanced

00:00:33.630 00:00:35.690
too before I make a purchase do check

00:00:35.940 00:00:37.340
with your spouse or your significant

00:00:37.590 00:00:39.650
other and see if they like it even if

00:00:39.840 00:00:41.780
you love this scent if your partner

00:00:42.059 00:00:43.430
doesn't want to be around you it's not

00:00:43.680 00:00:45.529
good for your relationship and there's

00:00:45.719 00:00:47.630
simply so many other cents out there and

00:00:48.149 00:00:49.069
chances that there's one that both of

00:00:49.260 00:00:51.590
you will like is very high do one or two

00:00:52.289 00:00:54.470
sprays max for a regular intensity

00:00:54.899 00:00:57.350
cologne for do wear Cologne that works

00:00:57.750 00:01:00.500
with other sense harmoniously maybe your

00:01:01.140 00:01:02.869
jacket has a certain smell maybe your

00:01:03.239 00:01:04.369
hair product has it just sort of smell

00:01:04.589 00:01:06.800
and you don't want colliding sense in

00:01:07.350 00:01:10.609
one ensemble because it may be off 5 do

00:01:11.040 00:01:13.010
spray and moisturize before putting on

00:01:13.470 00:01:15.649
Cologne that being said I suggest you go

00:01:15.810 00:01:18.170
with fragrance free lotion because it

00:01:18.570 00:01:21.200
won't impact the scent of the Cologne

00:01:21.689 00:01:23.270
stay clear of unscented body lotion

00:01:24.030 00:01:25.850
because despite its implication it

00:01:26.280 00:01:27.740
actually has different sense that's

00:01:28.170 00:01:30.530
supposed to emulate not a smell at all

00:01:30.960 00:01:33.260
and it can interfere with your Cologne 6

00:01:33.810 00:01:35.440
do buy cologne from a reputable store

00:01:36.450 00:01:38.390
because clones can be easily faked today

00:01:38.970 00:01:41.719
buying them on eBay or Amazon may be a

00:01:42.119 00:01:44.630
great way to get something that is faked

00:01:44.939 00:01:48.230
and even though the top note may be the

00:01:48.540 00:01:50.539
same or similar they can be watered down

00:01:51.149 00:01:53.060
there can be more alcohol and while you

00:01:53.220 00:01:54.679
think you saved a buck you actually

00:01:54.810 00:01:56.810
ended up with a lot of crap so always

00:01:57.149 00:01:58.969
buy from a trusted source now let's talk

00:01:59.040 00:02:00.440
about the don'ts of wearing Cologne

00:02:00.659 00:02:02.480
1 don't rub in Cologne on your skin but

00:02:02.549 00:02:05.240
I just settled naturally onto your skin

00:02:05.610 00:02:07.280
to don't work alone in the presence of

00:02:07.770 00:02:09.919
people which have allergies or an

00:02:10.200 00:02:11.300
aversion to Cologne you might think

00:02:11.580 00:02:12.780
people are really sensitive but

00:02:13.060 00:02:15.300
julius and people who collapse when they

00:02:15.549 00:02:16.860
smell Cologne for the same reason

00:02:17.290 00:02:19.380
don't use colons in hospitals or medical

00:02:20.200 00:02:22.259
facilities if you want to maybe go with

00:02:22.569 00:02:24.149
something very light definitely not with

00:02:24.310 00:02:26.459
something that's overpowering because it

00:02:26.709 00:02:28.319
can map negative impacts on the people

00:02:28.510 00:02:31.080
there 3 don't put on more cologne just

00:02:31.390 00:02:32.670
because you can't smell it anymore

00:02:32.890 00:02:33.929
over time your nose and your sense of

00:02:34.090 00:02:35.670
smell and gets desensitized for your

00:02:36.040 00:02:37.890
cologne so it's the best to ask someone

00:02:38.019 00:02:39.660
else that you know such as your partner

00:02:40.269 00:02:41.420
whether they can still smell it

00:02:42.430 00:02:44.610
otherwise you're just overpowering the

00:02:45.010 00:02:46.289
people around you don't put go on and

00:02:46.599 00:02:48.899
open sores through ears your mouth

00:02:49.150 00:02:50.970
or your private parts it's just not

00:02:51.250 00:02:52.800
meant to be there don't use aftershave

00:02:53.260 00:02:55.289
as a body cologne it has a very specific

00:02:55.569 00:02:58.559
purpose and alcohol or ethanol based

00:02:59.290 00:03:00.869
aftershaves are not up to date anymore

00:03:01.510 00:03:03.659
so it go with something else but that

00:03:03.879 00:03:05.789
being said the after shapes usually

00:03:06.010 00:03:07.500
don't last for a very long time and

00:03:07.629 00:03:09.539
they're not well suited as a body clone

00:03:10.209 00:03:11.699
likewise don't spray cologne in the air

00:03:12.010 00:03:14.069
and walk through it it's simply a waste

00:03:14.260 00:03:14.550
of it

00:03:14.919 00:03:16.619
so rather apply it directly on your skin

00:03:16.930 00:03:18.149
also don't apply come on in public

00:03:18.609 00:03:20.339
because just gaudy it's like clipping

00:03:20.560 00:03:22.649
your fingernails in public just do it at

00:03:22.780 00:03:25.289
home don't buy or use bargain colognes

00:03:25.599 00:03:27.180
from the drugstore it's something that's

00:03:27.519 00:03:29.789
reserved for teenage boys and no the

00:03:30.069 00:03:31.949
acts for Gillette won't make women

00:03:32.260 00:03:34.289
follow you around the block or fall from

00:03:34.389 00:03:35.729
the sky because they find you so

00:03:35.769 00:03:38.339
attractive also don't buy cologne for

00:03:38.470 00:03:40.289
the great-looking bottle most of the

00:03:40.569 00:03:42.659
times designers put a lot of effort in

00:03:42.790 00:03:44.670
the marketing as well as the bottle

00:03:45.400 00:03:47.189
because they want to associate things

00:03:47.500 00:03:48.960
with positive things in your life so you

00:03:49.209 00:03:51.629
like to send but ultimately always go

00:03:52.150 00:03:54.149
for what's in the bottle and try to

00:03:54.790 00:03:56.280
disregard the rest in the same vein

00:03:56.889 00:03:59.399
don't fall for these box packages which

00:03:59.560 00:04:01.619
are on sale because the body lotions are

00:04:01.989 00:04:03.449
usually not of a very high quality and

00:04:04.060 00:04:06.390
your skin can react differently because

00:04:06.549 00:04:08.909
it lingers longer on it honestly and

00:04:09.040 00:04:10.110
every day it's gonna be less expensive

00:04:10.780 00:04:12.360
than buying the whole set last but not

00:04:12.609 00:04:14.610
least don't save cologne for a special

00:04:15.819 00:04:18.810
because usually the essences inside can

00:04:18.849 00:04:20.520
be stabilized for about three years

00:04:20.950 00:04:23.159
after that they start to change the

00:04:23.620 00:04:25.640
aromatics change and it's just not

00:04:26.100 00:04:27.530
pleasant anymore and now the hundred

00:04:27.660 00:04:28.820
million little bottle may be tempting

00:04:29.310 00:04:31.280
but maybe you'll just use 50 milliliters

00:04:31.740 00:04:33.830
over three years so go for that one if

00:04:33.930 00:04:34.820

write your inbox in today's video i'm

00:04:45.000 00:04:46.909
wearing ledendi from there say which I

00:04:47.100 00:04:48.469
don't just like because of the bottle or

00:04:48.750 00:04:50.990
the name so for my jacket I'm using a

00:04:51.180 00:04:52.850
very light tone of brown which is

00:04:53.699 00:04:55.870
oatmeal with a herringbone pattern and

00:04:56.880 00:04:59.090
three Brown cuff buttons which indicate

00:04:59.130 00:05:00.409
that it's a little more sporty I'm

00:05:00.750 00:05:02.540
coming with a shirt that has white

00:05:03.120 00:05:06.110
yellow blue and brown stripes and as

00:05:06.330 00:05:08.779
such it's rather bold because of that I

00:05:09.360 00:05:11.510
combined it with a mottled darker net

00:05:11.760 00:05:14.180
hide with tones of blue and brown which

00:05:14.340 00:05:15.860
is made out of silk and from Fort

00:05:16.050 00:05:17.659
Belvedere just like the pocket square

00:05:18.270 00:05:19.730
which is made out of linen with

00:05:20.340 00:05:22.760
hand-stitched ex stitches and they're

00:05:23.100 00:05:24.379
hand rolled it's very hard to do that

00:05:25.050 00:05:26.810
but they pick up the same colors of blue

00:05:27.180 00:05:29.510
and yellow to create a harmonious look

00:05:29.970 00:05:31.700
my pants are navy with a faint

00:05:32.669 00:05:35.270
windowpane / check and my shoes have the

00:05:35.520 00:05:37.730
same brown color as the buttons on my

00:05:38.010 00:05:39.890
jacket because of that everything is

00:05:40.200 00:05:41.930
tied well together the socks I'm wearing

00:05:42.360 00:05:44.480
are navy and yellow shutters I have

00:05:44.729 00:05:45.740
socks from Fort Belvedere

00:05:45.900 00:05:48.140
and for selection of all the Fort
