00:00:18.810 00:00:21.349
hey this is Scott writer as most of you

00:00:21.390 00:00:23.169
know I have Parkinson's disease and

00:00:24.179 00:00:25.189
medications are essential to Parkinson's

00:00:25.800 00:00:27.560
disease but one of the most important

00:00:27.750 00:00:29.179
things to do is exercise on a daily

00:00:29.849 00:00:32.030
basis and the truth of the matter is

00:00:32.579 00:00:34.100
nobody really knows so however since for

00:00:34.519 00:00:37.579
sure why it's important that people that

00:00:38.070 00:00:39.530
exercise with PD know that they feel a

00:00:39.780 00:00:40.700
lot better than people that don't

00:00:41.239 00:00:43.460
exercise there's some theories that it

00:00:44.040 00:00:45.439
stimulates the production of dopamine

00:00:45.690 00:00:47.740
and when you get down to it Parkinson's

00:00:48.750 00:00:50.900
as a result of the lack of dopamine

00:00:51.239 00:00:53.330
production in the body so there are some

00:00:53.519 00:00:55.310
people that theorize that by doing

00:00:56.160 00:00:57.200
exercise especially getting your heart

00:00:57.359 00:00:59.660
rate up really high it produces a little

00:00:59.879 00:01:01.819
bit of dopamine you certainly feel

00:01:02.129 00:01:04.310
better I do know that much so I can't

00:01:04.710 00:01:06.080
stress how important it is to exercise

00:01:06.300 00:01:09.200
on a daily basis an exercise that a

00:01:09.509 00:01:11.719
really strenuous low so today come along

00:01:11.970 00:01:13.609
with me as we go to my gym right here in

00:01:13.710 00:01:15.919
the neighborhood and I work out with my

00:01:16.170 00:01:19.010
trainer Lee and I never know what he's

00:01:19.229 00:01:21.560
gonna have in store for me I look

00:01:21.869 00:01:22.280
forward to it

00:01:22.740 00:01:23.929
but I'm not gonna kid you I sort of

00:01:24.180 00:01:25.399
dread it at the same time because it's

00:01:25.500 00:01:28.539
not easy you'll get a see me in action

00:01:29.549 00:01:31.100
that may be good that may be bad that

00:01:31.920 00:01:37.630
certainly be entertaining

00:03:41.709 00:03:43.199
the amazing thing about exercise in

00:03:43.840 00:03:45.300
Parkinson's is not just how you feel

00:03:45.970 00:03:47.630
physically but how you feel emotionally

00:03:48.640 00:03:50.250
it's pretty common with Parkinson's

00:03:50.319 00:03:52.110
disease to have some level of depression

00:03:52.870 00:03:54.000
so you may have a family member out

00:03:54.250 00:03:56.100
there it could be your parent brother or

00:03:56.500 00:04:00.089
sister you know fan that has Parkinson's

00:04:00.280 00:04:01.559
and it's not exercising and my

00:04:01.720 00:04:03.839
encouragement to you is to encourage

00:04:04.180 00:04:06.240
them to give exercise a try that they'll

00:04:06.459 00:04:08.370
stick with it consistently they'll feel

00:04:08.410 00:04:10.020
better physically they'll feel better

00:04:11.190 00:04:13.170
emotionally it's just you have

00:04:13.780 00:04:14.640
Parkinson's you already have so many

00:04:14.860 00:04:16.620
things stacked against you everything

00:04:16.750 00:04:18.719
you can do to kind of give an upper edge

00:04:19.060 00:04:21.090
by eating well and exercising regularly

00:04:21.549 00:04:22.590
like we all should do whether we have

00:04:22.780 00:04:24.690
our concern or not gives you an

00:04:25.620 00:04:27.360
advantage you're not gonna be healed

00:04:27.550 00:04:28.560
from Parkinson's that there's that

00:04:28.740 00:04:30.740
expression called delay the disease

00:04:31.750 00:04:32.640
anything you can do to slow the

00:04:32.830 00:04:34.890
progression of the disease is a good

00:04:35.050 00:04:37.200
thing to do and it's generally agreed

00:04:37.360 00:04:39.780
that exercise does helpful a progression

00:04:39.910 00:04:41.100
of the disease now keep in mind it's

00:04:41.410 00:04:44.129
different for everybody but again if you

00:04:44.290 00:04:45.540
know somebody that has Parkinson's

00:04:45.760 00:04:48.420
that's not exercising encouraging to do

00:04:48.640 00:04:50.670
so maybe give them some literature and

00:04:50.770 00:04:52.200
the Parkinson's foundations or other

00:04:52.960 00:04:54.029
organizations we'll talk about the

00:04:54.430 00:04:56.310
importance of exercise as relates to
