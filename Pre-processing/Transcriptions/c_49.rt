00:00:00.390 00:00:01.819

00:00:02.220 00:00:04.130
Marco book club this month were reading

00:00:05.040 00:00:07.789
Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts okay

00:00:08.010 00:00:09.709
okay okay I know it's been a long time

00:00:10.260 00:00:12.020
since I have done a book club video and

00:00:12.179 00:00:14.509

00:00:14.700 00:00:16.700

00:00:17.160 00:00:19.189
vagabrothers and personally as well it's

00:00:19.380 00:00:21.200
been hard to find time to both read a

00:00:21.480 00:00:23.929

resolution for 2018 is be better about

00:00:28.410 00:00:30.740
making this more consistent but to buy

00:00:30.960 00:00:33.190
myself some time I'm gonna recommend a

00:00:34.200 00:00:38.420
1000-page book because very very much

00:00:38.910 00:00:40.430
worth the read so I'm going to tell you

00:00:40.500 00:00:42.440
a little bit about why I'm recommending

00:00:43.340 00:00:45.290
genre so as you might know we are

00:00:45.690 00:00:48.229
publishing our series from India we're

00:00:48.450 00:00:50.240
going to Rajasthan and I cannot

00:00:50.460 00:00:52.340
recommend a better accompaniment to that

00:00:52.620 00:00:55.369
series than this book ten years ago this

00:00:55.770 00:00:58.369
year Wow feeling old I graduated from

00:00:59.129 00:01:02.299
college at UCLA and I took a job in

00:01:03.000 00:01:04.850
India it was starting one week after

00:01:05.549 00:01:07.340
graduation and I didn't really have a

00:01:07.860 00:01:10.010
lot of information about the country I

00:01:10.380 00:01:11.000
didn't really know what I was getting

00:01:11.430 00:01:12.740
into I was working in economic

00:01:13.229 00:01:15.170
development basically working for a

00:01:15.780 00:01:17.170
sugar company that was based in Mumbai

00:01:18.180 00:01:19.700
and this book is one of the first things

00:01:19.979 00:01:22.280
that was recommended to me when I got to

00:01:22.650 00:01:24.230
India actually was recommended to me by

00:01:24.509 00:01:26.899
my mom who you might know works for

00:01:27.210 00:01:28.850
Delta Airlines and is a stewardess and

00:01:29.250 00:01:31.130
so she was flying back and forth from

00:01:31.259 00:01:33.499
New York to Mumbai which is the modern

00:01:33.780 00:01:35.990
name for Bombay the city where this book

00:01:36.210 00:01:39.830
is based Shantaram is based on the true

00:01:39.869 00:01:42.830
story of Gregory daily Roberts who is an

00:01:43.500 00:01:46.429
Australian he was arrested in 1979 for

00:01:46.829 00:01:49.399
armed robbery he was a heroin addict and

00:01:49.590 00:01:53.210
in 1980 while serving a 19 year sentence

00:01:53.820 00:01:55.760
for armed robbery he escaped from

00:01:56.369 00:01:57.950
maximum-security prison in Australia in

00:01:58.409 00:02:00.740
broad daylight got a fake passport and

00:02:01.649 00:02:03.050
travelled to India his plan was to

00:02:03.509 00:02:05.420
continue on to Europe to Germany I think

00:02:06.119 00:02:07.999
to escape the law but when he got to

00:02:08.459 00:02:10.490
India he met a couple characters who

00:02:10.950 00:02:12.860
convinced him to stay in the

00:02:13.080 00:02:15.860
of Bombay or like I said Mumbai these

00:02:16.140 00:02:18.770
days so if I use Mumbai interchangeably

00:02:18.870 00:02:20.869
with Bombay that's just because it's a

00:02:21.269 00:02:23.059
modern name for the city it was changed

00:02:23.129 00:02:24.710
I think the late in the 1990s

00:02:25.290 00:02:27.770
so the real life story of Gregory David

00:02:28.170 00:02:29.690
Roberts and the novel are very very

00:02:30.030 00:02:31.309
closely intertwined it's hard to tell

00:02:31.680 00:02:33.380
apart fact from fiction and he intended

00:02:33.510 00:02:35.960
that the novel read like fiction but be

00:02:36.299 00:02:38.509
so based in real experience that feels

00:02:38.879 00:02:40.399
extremely factual and that is one of the

00:02:40.760 00:02:43.670
most mesmerizing and amazing things

00:02:43.769 00:02:44.990
about this book is like you're reading

00:02:45.090 00:02:47.030
this and you can't tell that what's

00:02:47.489 00:02:48.500
fictional because it's so well written

00:02:48.959 00:02:51.199
you know that he lived through all the

00:02:51.569 00:02:52.789
insane experiences that happen in this

00:02:53.040 00:02:55.009
book I think this is the largest book

00:02:55.170 00:02:57.770
I've ever read the closest thing that

00:02:58.319 00:03:00.729
I've read to this is Anna Karenina

00:03:01.739 00:03:04.039
pronunciation check which is 863 pages

00:03:04.260 00:03:05.869
and one of the reasons that it's good to

00:03:06.090 00:03:07.910
read a big sweeping novel like this is

00:03:08.250 00:03:10.220
because a book like this is able to

00:03:10.440 00:03:13.460
touch on love on war and philosophy and

00:03:13.680 00:03:15.920
all these other themes that are just not

00:03:16.319 00:03:18.080
able to be completely fleshed out in a

00:03:18.269 00:03:20.360
short novel it takes really the

00:03:20.940 00:03:21.710
experiences that this character goes

00:03:22.010 00:03:25.009
through to really elucidate those themes

00:03:25.799 00:03:27.979
and I read this book when I got to India

00:03:28.049 00:03:29.809
I was completely overwhelmed by the

00:03:30.299 00:03:31.909
country if you've ever been to India you

00:03:31.950 00:03:33.559
know that there's so much culture shock

00:03:34.049 00:03:34.909
happening and there's really nothing

00:03:34.950 00:03:37.309
that can prepare you for a trip to India

00:03:38.250 00:03:40.250
perhaps besides this book within a

00:03:40.500 00:03:42.050
couple pages of the book beginning

00:03:42.840 00:03:44.960
Gregory David Roberts character whose

00:03:45.150 00:03:47.539
name's Lin in the story Lin for Lindsay

00:03:48.449 00:03:51.319
Lin meets a character named pravakar who

00:03:51.540 00:03:53.720
is a tour guide in Mumbai and pravakar

00:03:54.000 00:03:55.550
comes his friend and he is basically a

00:03:55.829 00:03:58.129
vehicle to explain so much about Indian

00:03:58.379 00:03:59.930
culture that leaves most travelers

00:04:00.599 00:04:02.180
confused from the head wobble what does

00:04:02.310 00:04:04.069
the head wobble mean to why are people

00:04:04.379 00:04:06.080
begging on the street how do you have

00:04:06.299 00:04:08.119
all in the bazaars how come your tour

00:04:08.459 00:04:10.819
guide or your hostel owners trying to

00:04:11.099 00:04:12.259
charge you a little bit more money how

00:04:12.449 00:04:14.240
much should you negotiate what do other

00:04:14.940 00:04:16.250
travelers think about India should you

00:04:16.410 00:04:18.589
go to the city she go to the rural areas

00:04:19.139 00:04:21.440
why are there so many slums how come

00:04:21.989 00:04:23.750
Indians do XYZ I mean you can just keep

00:04:23.820 00:04:25.909
going on they address all these themes

00:04:26.490 00:04:30.290
the book Lin basically he stops running

00:04:30.720 00:04:31.850
from the law when he gets to India he

00:04:32.070 00:04:33.620
feels extremely comfortable in the city

00:04:33.750 00:04:35.749
of Mumbai which if you've never been is

00:04:36.630 00:04:38.450
absolutely a fantastic city I felt the

00:04:38.610 00:04:40.370
same way when I got there I thought how

00:04:40.740 00:04:43.219
is this this beautiful city not more

00:04:43.470 00:04:45.379
well known by people from my own country

00:04:45.630 00:04:47.420
how did I know so little about this

00:04:48.030 00:04:49.999
fascinating place I was completely

00:04:50.490 00:04:52.580
caught off guard when I got to India I

00:04:53.490 00:04:54.860
remember getting off the airplane and

00:04:55.320 00:04:57.050
instantly seeing the largest slum in

00:04:57.300 00:04:59.000
Asia right outside the freeway and

00:04:59.280 00:05:02.029
having to grapple with that reality was

00:05:02.940 00:05:04.520
extremely difficult for me as a 22 year

00:05:04.560 00:05:05.810
old it's one that you know still the

00:05:06.240 00:05:08.180
existence of such widespread poverty in

00:05:08.280 00:05:10.820
our world next to amazing affluence is

00:05:11.729 00:05:13.210
really hard to square in your own brain

00:05:14.220 00:05:15.710
why are some people in that situation

00:05:16.260 00:05:18.020
while other people are driving families

00:05:18.810 00:05:20.360
and so that's kind of what this book

00:05:21.000 00:05:23.930
gets at the Lin moves from staying in a

00:05:24.180 00:05:26.060
hostel in Colaba which is the colonial

00:05:26.729 00:05:28.310
old colonial center of the city which is

00:05:28.530 00:05:30.320
where the offices of my company were

00:05:30.570 00:05:33.290
based he moves from there into a slum

00:05:34.110 00:05:35.839
eventually where he is uh he's just

00:05:36.360 00:05:37.100
because he's got a little bit of

00:05:37.620 00:05:39.260
first-aid training he becomes the slum

00:05:39.840 00:05:42.409
doctor for this huge slum there's a

00:05:42.840 00:05:44.060
cholera outbreak and he deals with that

00:05:44.490 00:05:46.670
and he becomes very well-grounded it's

00:05:46.830 00:05:48.589
kind of a way for him as a former

00:05:48.870 00:05:51.170
criminal and a former heroin addict to

00:05:51.419 00:05:54.350
start dealing with in making repentance

00:05:54.840 00:05:56.390
for his former sin but meanwhile he

00:05:57.150 00:05:59.120
before that he's going into the bars of

00:06:00.030 00:06:02.180
which is this really cool old part of

00:06:02.580 00:06:04.219
you know just kind of high-water mark of

00:06:04.380 00:06:05.960
the British Empire like these old

00:06:06.449 00:06:07.850
colonial buildings some of them restored

00:06:08.070 00:06:09.800
some of them falling into ruin

00:06:10.199 00:06:11.149
but there's one bar they're called

00:06:11.880 00:06:12.770
Leopold's and that's where most of the

00:06:13.229 00:06:14.990
action of the story takes place he meets

00:06:15.240 00:06:18.200
this international crew of expatriates

00:06:18.690 00:06:19.850
who were all kind of involved in the

00:06:20.070 00:06:22.210
black market or in some sort of crime

00:06:23.220 00:06:25.279
benign crime not murderers by any regard

00:06:25.560 00:06:27.379
but laundering money making fake

00:06:28.139 00:06:29.960
passports this sort of thing and because

00:06:30.090 00:06:31.610
he's a former criminal he knows how to

00:06:31.830 00:06:33.080
speak their language he becomes friends

00:06:33.240 00:06:35.480
with them so while he's in the slum he's

00:06:35.729 00:06:37.219
also kind of involved in the underworld

00:06:38.060 00:06:40.250
and Leopold's is still a play

00:06:40.500 00:06:42.230
where a lot of people go it's where I

00:06:42.540 00:06:44.060
used to go get a beer every day after

00:06:44.310 00:06:45.710
work I'd go to Leopold's I'd read this

00:06:46.020 00:06:47.300
book and you can really imagine

00:06:47.910 00:06:49.540
everything happening there it says huge

00:06:50.550 00:06:52.340
vaulted ceilings with these giant fans

00:06:52.620 00:06:54.560
that swing down they put out peanuts for

00:06:54.660 00:06:56.600
you to have something a snack on when

00:06:56.670 00:06:57.800
you drink a Kingfisher and you have

00:06:57.930 00:07:00.290
these large archways looking out on the

00:07:00.570 00:07:02.180
street it's really an amazing place and

00:07:02.490 00:07:04.820
this book has put it on the map in fact

00:07:05.040 00:07:07.010
my mom when she was working going to

00:07:07.380 00:07:09.290
Mumbai for work she met Gregory David

00:07:09.630 00:07:11.510
Roberts at Leopold's two or three times

00:07:11.760 00:07:13.790
and this book right here is actually

00:07:14.720 00:07:17.450
sign somewhere there it is signed by the

00:07:18.030 00:07:21.500
my mom got that and he says October 16

00:07:22.250 00:07:25.490
2007 Leopold's Mumbai for Jill may all

00:07:25.710 00:07:27.440

cherish you and always stay true to your

00:07:29.610 00:07:31.370
precious love beautiful words for a

00:07:32.040 00:07:33.410
former bank robber and heroin addict no

00:07:34.110 00:07:36.470
each set transformation from a hardened

00:07:36.510 00:07:39.770
criminal and a convict into a man who is

00:07:39.900 00:07:42.770
in touch with his spirituality and his

00:07:43.110 00:07:45.410
heart that makes the book what it is the

00:07:45.840 00:07:48.230
title shot ramchandra means man of peace

00:07:48.570 00:07:50.330
they give him this name that at the time

00:07:50.610 00:07:52.010
as a former criminal he doesn't even

00:07:52.350 00:07:54.170
believe that he has the capacity to

00:07:54.500 00:07:56.390
fulfill it's through his work as a slum

00:07:56.760 00:07:58.580
doctor and all the work that happens

00:07:58.830 00:08:00.260
later that he is able to make that

00:08:00.720 00:08:02.570
transformation and I think it's it's

00:08:02.820 00:08:05.180
it's that theme of redemption the theme

00:08:05.220 00:08:08.840
of exile the theme of trying to make

00:08:09.120 00:08:10.670
peace with the world that makes this

00:08:10.890 00:08:13.460
book so riveting at one point he becomes

00:08:13.650 00:08:16.160
the apprentice of a mafia under Lord

00:08:16.830 00:08:18.440
Carter by Cotter becomes a father figure

00:08:18.720 00:08:20.450
and he's a philosopher he's a gangster

00:08:20.700 00:08:22.400
but he's a philosopher and there's a

00:08:22.710 00:08:24.200
number of other characters who all flesh

00:08:24.480 00:08:26.120
out the meaning of life in one way or

00:08:26.250 00:08:28.340
another hence the reason this book is

00:08:28.980 00:08:30.620
1000 pages it's got so many diverse

00:08:30.960 00:08:34.250
viewpoints so many insane situations and

00:08:34.590 00:08:36.200
not to mention it's a love story just to

00:08:36.419 00:08:38.120
kind of end this with a personal note

00:08:38.460 00:08:39.980
rather than telling you what happens in

00:08:40.080 00:08:43.520
the story so I read this book when I was

00:08:43.979 00:08:44.930
in India

00:08:45.120 00:08:46.450
it took me you know about a month

00:08:47.540 00:08:49.760
however it was really crazy because

00:08:50.610 00:08:51.860
Leopold's the cafe where they worked at

00:08:52.800 00:08:54.679
where they hung out at was like I said a

00:08:54.990 00:08:56.840
place where I would go almost every day

00:08:57.360 00:08:58.939
you know maybe three times a week when I

00:08:59.129 00:09:00.139
would get out of work

00:09:00.749 00:09:03.259
my office is when I was in Mumbai we're

00:09:03.449 00:09:04.549
just down the street and I would walk

00:09:04.619 00:09:06.170
down there have a beer with my

00:09:06.389 00:09:08.150
co-workers and talk about what I was

00:09:08.309 00:09:09.769
gonna do with my life I was looking for

00:09:10.110 00:09:12.319
guidance at the time 22 years old not

00:09:12.540 00:09:14.689
sure what he'd do with my life and this

00:09:15.179 00:09:16.699
novel really kind of made me realize

00:09:17.220 00:09:18.859
that I wanted to be a writer like I

00:09:19.170 00:09:21.169
loved how this man had lived this crazy

00:09:21.480 00:09:25.069
life and found inspiration to turn his

00:09:26.009 00:09:28.519
real life experiences into a fictional

00:09:28.679 00:09:30.980
story that was able in many ways to tell

00:09:31.230 00:09:32.629
more truths than the a straight

00:09:33.629 00:09:36.019
autobiography so it was during those

00:09:36.269 00:09:38.989
moments having a beer at Leopold's cafe

00:09:39.509 00:09:40.699
thinking about this book that I decided

00:09:41.009 00:09:43.040
that even though my boss at the time in

00:09:43.259 00:09:44.449
Mumbai had offered me a full-time

00:09:44.639 00:09:46.309
position to stay in the city that I

00:09:46.709 00:09:49.489
wanted to try to get into writing and do

00:09:49.800 00:09:51.650
travel writing so I turned down the job

00:09:52.439 00:09:54.019
after about five months of living in

00:09:54.300 00:09:56.210
India after going to Rajasthan that

00:09:56.519 00:09:57.619
traveled up in Rajasthan when I finished

00:09:57.749 00:10:00.739
my job and and went and was doing some

00:10:01.019 00:10:02.480
blogging there my first blogs when I was

00:10:02.550 00:10:04.009
in Rajasthan and thinking about what I

00:10:04.199 00:10:06.499
want to do so I left the city and about

00:10:06.779 00:10:09.710
a week or so later there was the famous

00:10:10.199 00:10:12.049
terrorist attacks that happened on

00:10:12.540 00:10:14.600
Mumbai where a number of Pakistani

00:10:15.269 00:10:18.259
terrorists came in to very nearby the

00:10:18.509 00:10:20.030
Gateway of India unloaded they attacked

00:10:20.309 00:10:23.030
the Taj Mahal Hotel which is where the

00:10:23.249 00:10:25.009
flight attendants from Delta used to

00:10:25.290 00:10:26.869
stay so my mom used to stay there and I

00:10:26.999 00:10:29.059
would visit her they attacked Leopold's

00:10:29.399 00:10:31.939
they shot the whole cafe up and threw a

00:10:32.160 00:10:34.220
couple grenades into into the building

00:10:34.949 00:10:36.619
and there was you know dozens people

00:10:36.839 00:10:38.509
killed and many more injured during that

00:10:39.120 00:10:40.669
during that attack and so it made me

00:10:40.920 00:10:43.009
think that if I had stayed around if I

00:10:43.470 00:10:44.689
taken the safer route which was

00:10:45.029 00:10:47.360
obviously an amazing opportunity to stay

00:10:47.399 00:10:49.970
in Mumbai and keep living there that I

00:10:50.429 00:10:52.129
probably would have been at Leopold's

00:10:52.439 00:10:54.230
having a beer when that happened that's

00:10:54.449 00:10:56.989
at least what my first thought was when

00:10:57.179 00:10:59.269
that happened so it kind of gave me a

00:10:59.399 00:11:00.799
little bit more a personal reason to

00:11:01.470 00:11:03.470
follow my heart that it at least in that

00:11:04.079 00:11:05.210
situation it got me out of what could

00:11:05.549 00:11:05.740
have been

00:11:05.990 00:11:09.430
actually been a fatal situation um so I

00:11:09.980 00:11:12.340
definitely need to go back to Mumbai go

00:11:12.500 00:11:15.130
back to Leopold's and and see how

00:11:15.560 00:11:16.840
everything is since I was last there I

00:11:17.060 00:11:18.400
know that they were planning on making a

00:11:18.770 00:11:20.560
movie Johnny Depp was gonna be the main

00:11:20.960 00:11:23.440
lead but I think after the attacks they

00:11:23.720 00:11:25.960
put the movie on pause I'd lost some bit

00:11:26.000 00:11:28.420
of momentum so I do not know if there is

00:11:28.910 00:11:31.000
a movie still in process I know that

00:11:31.220 00:11:33.550
there is supposedly a follow-up to this

00:11:33.830 00:11:35.230
book I've not read it myself I don't

00:11:35.540 00:11:36.880
know how it is if you have read that

00:11:37.130 00:11:38.470
book leave some comments down below

00:11:39.080 00:11:40.600
however if this book seems too heavy for

00:11:40.940 00:11:43.390
you I would say like weight wise I would

00:11:43.580 00:11:44.530
say that you should check out the

00:11:45.230 00:11:46.780
audiobook now I've listened to a few

00:11:47.000 00:11:48.370
books on audible I'm just starting to

00:11:48.470 00:11:50.950
get into it I downloaded the audible

00:11:51.110 00:11:53.170
version of this in order to I think it's

00:11:53.270 00:11:55.600
gonna be a way that I reread books I've

00:11:55.850 00:11:56.590
already read because it's a different

00:11:57.050 00:11:59.080
perspective the guy who does narration

00:11:59.270 00:12:01.270
is so good he's Australian but he does

00:12:01.460 00:12:02.650
so many different accents and there are

00:12:02.810 00:12:03.340
so many people from different

00:12:04.030 00:12:06.580
nationalities Iranians Afghan ease you

00:12:06.710 00:12:09.580
know Palestinians French German Swiss

00:12:10.190 00:12:11.770
everything he just jumps from accent to

00:12:12.140 00:12:14.470
accent and he paints this vivid picture

00:12:14.960 00:12:16.720
that I would say rivals the writing

00:12:16.970 00:12:19.240
itself in the book so it's about 45

00:12:20.089 00:12:22.510
hours of audio book if you can stomach

00:12:22.700 00:12:24.700
that download it I'll put a link down

00:12:24.950 00:12:26.800
below in the the info box I'll put a

00:12:26.960 00:12:28.900
link to the book I'll put one on Amazon

00:12:29.630 00:12:31.090
if you buy a book through that link it

00:12:31.130 00:12:32.350

00:12:33.140 00:12:36.220

00:12:38.630 00:12:40.150
always encourage you guys to buy books

00:12:40.370 00:12:42.820

00:12:43.010 00:12:44.440

00:12:44.690 00:12:46.150
