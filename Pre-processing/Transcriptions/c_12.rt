00:00:00.210 00:00:02.090
hey everyone this is own Fox here from

00:00:02.370 00:00:04.370
own Fox Trot Oregon higher-self herbes

00:00:04.799 00:00:07.130
calm welcome to the video today I was

00:00:07.589 00:00:10.190
asked about and Parkinson's disease or

00:00:10.590 00:00:12.110
Alzheimer's if I correct what would I

00:00:12.420 00:00:13.879
recommend so I'm just gonna make a quick

00:00:14.400 00:00:15.890
videos waterwater recommend first of all

00:00:16.080 00:00:18.380
I'd recommend an optic or take coconut

00:00:18.810 00:00:20.870
oil it's been shown in clinical studies

00:00:20.939 00:00:22.730
to be very good for brain and nerve

00:00:22.769 00:00:27.589
tissue to gray matter the the fatty

00:00:28.349 00:00:30.259
coating the myelin sheaths of nerve

00:00:30.630 00:00:33.160
cells so it's been shown to improve

00:00:34.170 00:00:36.680
brain function memory and Alzheimer's

00:00:36.930 00:00:38.810
and possibly Parkinson's I can't really

00:00:39.149 00:00:40.819
remember if it's Parkinson's as well but

00:00:40.980 00:00:42.500
I'm sure it probably does help so either

00:00:42.660 00:00:43.790
way I take maybe one to two

00:00:44.550 00:00:46.900
tablespoonfuls of coconut oil per day

00:00:47.910 00:00:49.940
number two what I take would be I take

00:00:50.309 00:00:51.889
turmeric powder I already take turmeric

00:00:52.110 00:00:53.810
red as it is and as it is every day

00:00:54.030 00:00:54.920
actually make my own homemade coconut

00:00:55.260 00:00:56.630
milk which includes I don't know how

00:00:56.760 00:00:58.130
much oil is in a coconut but I think

00:00:58.260 00:01:00.650
around a co-branded coconut a day the

00:01:00.899 00:01:02.450
brown did I make my own cold milk with

00:01:02.789 00:01:05.060
so I'm getting in my raw coconut oil

00:01:05.369 00:01:07.910
there into my body too so number to be

00:01:08.430 00:01:10.190
turmeric I've just ordered and gone some

00:01:10.560 00:01:12.350
turmeric and from the internet and

00:01:12.960 00:01:14.510
organic turmeric even if it isn't

00:01:14.790 00:01:15.859
organic I've been taking non-organic

00:01:16.350 00:01:17.929
turmeric you zombies too finicky in my

00:01:18.390 00:01:19.460
personal opinion I've had very good

00:01:19.619 00:01:21.800
results taking turmeric turmeric it and

00:01:22.290 00:01:23.510
coconut oil but I know turmeric

00:01:24.030 00:01:25.010
especially it's very anti-inflammatory

00:01:26.009 00:01:28.370
it's full of antioxidants a deep rich

00:01:29.009 00:01:31.010
orangey colour it's been shown to be

00:01:31.229 00:01:33.170
better than like loads of pharmaceutical

00:01:33.210 00:01:36.020
drugs like 12 or 15 or something won't

00:01:36.360 00:01:40.609
warn head-on clash tests and to my lips

00:01:40.829 00:01:42.859
are some natural no side effects really

00:01:43.049 00:01:45.139
good for you a lot of like nutrients in

00:01:45.270 00:01:47.870
it like David's minerals nourishing so

00:01:48.630 00:01:50.569
so take turmeric it's a no-brainer it's

00:01:50.880 00:01:52.670
a super help to be honest it's if I

00:01:52.829 00:01:54.859
could live a wild green superfood and

00:01:55.710 00:01:56.929
blend that I made from wild kratts

00:01:57.479 00:02:00.170
superfoods like my curb stop below have

00:02:00.210 00:02:03.109
a look for yourself herbs and if I was

00:02:03.240 00:02:05.530
actually thinking that like just add one

00:02:06.540 00:02:08.630
if I got that too or just one what are

00:02:08.759 00:02:11.210
two other ingredients it might have my

00:02:11.550 00:02:12.050
favorite hair

00:02:12.810 00:02:14.510
extract Pedro that it's charged it's

00:02:15.209 00:02:16.400
unbelievable which isn't the turtle I

00:02:16.650 00:02:18.530
wanted to recommend but dude the second

00:02:18.810 00:02:20.600
thing would be turmeric it's kick-ass

00:02:21.030 00:02:22.699
it's multifunctional it's powerful and

00:02:23.280 00:02:25.280
that's the reason why I would add chaga

00:02:26.069 00:02:28.670
to my super food plans too because just

00:02:29.220 00:02:31.100
thorn believe with my favorite herb I'll

00:02:31.440 00:02:33.949
put up a video to target describing all

00:02:34.020 00:02:35.630
the better here why it's my favorite

00:02:35.730 00:02:37.610
herb and why I recommend it as an

00:02:38.310 00:02:39.440
unbelievable hair it's so

00:02:40.380 00:02:42.290
multifunctional very potent so I have

00:02:42.660 00:02:44.600
like I have what wild chocolate chunks

00:02:44.730 00:02:47.030

the video is not finished so continue on

00:03:07.430 00:03:11.350
and so that'll be coconut oil turmeric

00:03:12.360 00:03:14.360
and chaga so I think we wanted to I

00:03:14.489 00:03:16.400
think around to to treat teaspoon full

00:03:16.590 00:03:17.479
of turmeric add a just let you know

00:03:18.000 00:03:22.460
dosages triad chug every day into my my

00:03:22.950 00:03:24.620
blender my into my coconut milk I add in

00:03:24.810 00:03:28.880
like some chaga extract powder it's my

00:03:29.010 00:03:32.810
audience Ohashi we've had in maca whoo I

00:03:33.150 00:03:34.400
highly recommend mica but not for

00:03:34.829 00:03:35.810
Alzheimer's or Parkinson's necessarily

00:03:35.910 00:03:37.009
it's great for your hormonal system yes

00:03:37.799 00:03:40.729
energy and stuff it's like Ashley Mac is

00:03:40.859 00:03:41.780
one of my favorite herbs to be honest

00:03:42.299 00:03:44.090
but for practices of Alzheimer's this

00:03:44.370 00:03:45.440
isn't what I'm recommending I'm

00:03:45.780 00:03:48.710
recommending turmeric coconut oil Chaka

00:03:49.500 00:03:51.080
and I'd recommend the fourth which I

00:03:51.180 00:03:52.699
actually added to my smoothies as well

00:03:53.310 00:03:54.920
daily holiday how the air stays so forth

00:03:55.079 00:03:57.530
so on is mucuna McCune is an ayurvedic

00:03:57.720 00:03:59.000
herb also known as a velvet bean it's

00:03:59.400 00:04:02.599
very very rich in l-dopa which is being

00:04:02.700 00:04:04.880
shown people with parkinson's are

00:04:05.489 00:04:07.580
severely lacking in l-dopa or l-dub or

00:04:07.859 00:04:10.009
dopamine so some people say actually

00:04:10.320 00:04:13.190
practice is a long term deficiency of

00:04:13.470 00:04:15.740
l-dopa now l-dopa gets depleted when we

00:04:16.079 00:04:19.400
do drugs or in unhealthy your own

00:04:19.829 00:04:22.000
balance our highly stressful physically

00:04:23.010 00:04:24.660
or otherwise lifestyle on health

00:04:25.060 00:04:26.850
lifestyle okay so especially with drugs

00:04:27.190 00:04:29.070
we go high and go low we go high we

00:04:29.290 00:04:30.960
gonna love taking too much drugs for too

00:04:31.870 00:04:35.400
doctor please oil our dopamine so mccune

00:04:35.560 00:04:39.570
is nature's richest source of l-dopa so

00:04:39.730 00:04:41.070
it'll help that's the precursor to

00:04:41.440 00:04:44.940
making no making up to making dopamine

00:04:46.890 00:04:49.410
so it'll help practices immensely it

00:04:49.690 00:04:51.570
helps with shakes it kinda helps with

00:04:51.960 00:04:54.390
shakes shaking like twitching nervous

00:04:54.640 00:04:56.430
system disorders and brain issues it

00:04:56.710 00:04:58.740
helps relieve stress depression anxiety

00:05:00.750 00:05:03.840
fear feeling down unmotivated no zest

00:05:04.090 00:05:07.290
for life so dope dopamine and will

00:05:07.510 00:05:08.910
help neurotransmitters in your brain to

00:05:08.950 00:05:11.190
be boosted to feel happier more

00:05:11.740 00:05:12.960
satisfied to give up addictions to

00:05:13.810 00:05:14.970
because you won't be seeking this like

00:05:15.160 00:05:17.070
big open then stimulation of your brain

00:05:17.860 00:05:18.650
neurotransmitters it's pretty steady

00:05:19.660 00:05:22.980
ongoing healthy balanced array of

00:05:23.620 00:05:24.080
nutrients and

00:05:25.090 00:05:26.820
l-dopa so your body can produce dopamine

00:05:27.640 00:05:29.520
so I'd highly recommend mucuna first of

00:05:29.650 00:05:32.130
all at coconut oil turmeric and chaga

00:05:34.080 00:05:36.990
and Shagga is the third like the least

00:05:37.540 00:05:39.810
important of those three but like it

00:05:40.030 00:05:41.310
could be maybe even more important I

00:05:41.470 00:05:42.870
don't really know maybe they shouldn't

00:05:43.000 00:05:45.900
even say that chaga is like massively

00:05:46.690 00:05:47.580
multifunctional asthma it's my favorite

00:05:47.680 00:05:48.870
herb in the world it's rich in

00:05:49.630 00:05:51.030
antioxidants it's rich in melanin which

00:05:51.130 00:05:53.310
is a brain foods great for pineal gland

00:05:53.980 00:05:55.410
it's good for your mind and your

00:05:55.450 00:05:57.480
emotions it's good for energy it's

00:05:58.450 00:05:59.670
protective against radiation against

00:05:59.860 00:06:01.470
free radical damage to get acidosis

00:06:01.840 00:06:03.390
which can be often also to cause with

00:06:04.540 00:06:06.060
degenerative diseases it helps blood

00:06:06.370 00:06:08.580
sugar diabetes cholesterol blood

00:06:09.270 00:06:11.460
pressure it's a ridiculously good hair

00:06:11.500 00:06:13.020
but it helps with a million different

00:06:13.270 00:06:19.380
things and so it's also nature's also

00:06:19.870 00:06:21.990
super rich in antioxidants super duper

00:06:22.180 00:06:24.210
it's an esse D which is massively helps

00:06:24.870 00:06:27.180
and to scavenge free radicals and

00:06:27.460 00:06:28.680
protect our body and ourselves and

00:06:29.050 00:06:31.380
organs and our brain included and helps

00:06:31.510 00:06:34.770
increase energy levels so overall that's

00:06:34.960 00:06:36.629
what I'd go for at the moment

00:06:36.849 00:06:38.670
it's anything else obviously I recommend

00:06:38.860 00:06:40.920
raw vegan diet more solely used a pair

00:06:41.400 00:06:44.700
of living and raw foods eat less or to

00:06:44.830 00:06:48.290
eat truly try no to less animal products

00:06:49.300 00:06:51.059
animals themselves like the meat or fish

00:06:51.939 00:06:53.999
dairy or eggs they all cause congestion

00:06:54.249 00:06:56.790
and acidosis it's like a public lie that

00:06:56.979 00:06:58.019
are really good for you and who's the

00:06:58.180 00:07:00.290
ones lying the people selling the deer

00:07:01.300 00:07:03.269
it's like it's just a joke like look at

00:07:03.340 00:07:05.129
the modern culture we're all bloody

00:07:05.919 00:07:08.010
extremely sick oh why all wild animals

00:07:08.469 00:07:10.260
never get sick because they're eating

00:07:10.509 00:07:11.969
their food but we're eating like old

00:07:12.719 00:07:15.570
rotting toxic to hell food it affects

00:07:15.729 00:07:17.159
our brain and gets in a blood it affects

00:07:17.500 00:07:17.939
every organ

00:07:18.400 00:07:20.820
it's weird unnaturally six species the

00:07:20.979 00:07:22.769
most glowing healthy vibrant people I

00:07:22.840 00:07:24.600
know of our obviously the people eating

00:07:24.759 00:07:27.240
raw foods raw veganism or at least raw

00:07:27.550 00:07:30.029
foods and people have just blessed with

00:07:30.219 00:07:32.040
really good genetics but people who hail

00:07:32.080 00:07:33.089
from the biggest thicknesses of the

00:07:33.370 00:07:34.920
people go on to fruit based fruit and

00:07:35.110 00:07:37.649
salad diets I did it myself

00:07:37.779 00:07:40.439
I used to be bloody sick as hell and now

00:07:40.689 00:07:42.570
I'm getting awesome as hell Ausmus

00:07:42.969 00:07:45.119
heaven so this is what I recommend for

00:07:45.699 00:07:47.670
Alzheimer's and Parkinson's so brain

00:07:48.339 00:07:49.829
protective neuron regenerative food

00:07:50.589 00:07:51.570
another thing you could recommend the

00:07:51.789 00:07:53.279
fifth one will be the lion's mane it's

00:07:53.500 00:07:56.159
an air every generator so it's also a

00:07:56.979 00:08:00.290
brain and protective um generate

00:08:01.300 00:08:03.240
regenerator - so they're the five you

00:08:03.399 00:08:05.700
can see the mucuna on my hair up shop

00:08:05.830 00:08:07.139

00:08:07.449 00:08:08.850
which is what a would also recommend or

00:08:08.919 00:08:10.110
at least two green smoothies I'd

00:08:10.479 00:08:12.029
recommend green smoothies every day I'd

00:08:12.639 00:08:16.379
recommend or else or and and juices if

00:08:16.449 00:08:17.639
you don't do fresh juices do green

00:08:18.009 00:08:18.899
smoothie if you don't do green smoothie

00:08:19.000 00:08:20.730
or juice at least get into haribol
