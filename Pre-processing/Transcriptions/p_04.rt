00:00:00.570 00:00:03.740
hey folks I'm not poor you dude and I

00:00:04.370 00:00:06.260
have Parkinson's disease

00:00:06.779 00:00:09.110
this was my random fact number one if

00:00:09.300 00:00:11.629
you missed it since I started doing the

00:00:11.820 00:00:14.629
daily dude videos but I started that

00:00:15.059 00:00:17.900
video and camera battery ran out and

00:00:18.060 00:00:20.769
then I recorded it again the battery

00:00:21.779 00:00:24.200
went out again and I just it's not a

00:00:24.660 00:00:26.929
topic I like talking about over and over

00:00:27.300 00:00:29.419
and over and over and over so I've been

00:00:29.640 00:00:32.209
putting it off in here we go I have

00:00:32.880 00:00:34.790
Parkinson's disease I was diagnosed and

00:00:35.190 00:00:39.380
when I was 35 years old and hindsight

00:00:39.870 00:00:41.750
the symptoms started showing up when I

00:00:41.969 00:00:45.920
was probably 30 or 31 I had mentioned in

00:00:45.989 00:00:48.139
the previous video that I'm just like

00:00:48.750 00:00:51.529
Michael J Fox and Muhammad Ali except

00:00:52.129 00:00:54.080
that stuff that they've got a lot of

00:00:54.270 00:00:56.779
money and well Michael J Fox is still

00:00:57.149 00:00:59.389
alive unfortunately Muhammad Ali passed

00:01:00.210 00:01:01.849
but that's something about Parkinson's

00:01:02.640 00:01:04.609
though is that it's different for

00:01:04.920 00:01:07.100
everybody there's not one set of

00:01:07.770 00:01:11.149
symptoms that applies to everybody if it

00:01:11.460 00:01:13.820
is different you know I've got to

00:01:14.070 00:01:16.100
believe it's different for everybody

00:01:16.500 00:01:19.090
who's got it I have young onset

00:01:20.100 00:01:24.289
Parkinson's which for people younger

00:01:24.600 00:01:26.480
like in their 30s Michael J Fox I

00:01:26.790 00:01:29.810
believe was diagnosed when he was in his

00:01:30.000 00:01:32.719
early 30s also so that's the definition

00:01:33.509 00:01:36.410
for some of us most people who get

00:01:37.229 00:01:38.719
Parkinson's it's in their later years

00:01:39.329 00:01:42.770
after the age of 55 it's kind of rare

00:01:43.229 00:01:47.179
for for young people to to get it the

00:01:48.030 00:01:52.039
causes of Parkinson's are in about 5% of

00:01:52.710 00:01:56.149
cases it is hereditary it is genetic so

00:01:56.640 00:01:59.270
if it runs in your family you you do

00:01:59.310 00:02:01.609
have a chance of getting it but for the

00:02:01.799 00:02:04.789
rest of us out there it is a mystery as

00:02:05.189 00:02:09.080
to what the causes are there is no there

00:02:09.300 00:02:12.290
there's no cure but there also is no

00:02:12.690 00:02:15.530
test for Parkinson's you know unlike

00:02:16.410 00:02:19.610
being maybe diabetic you know they can

00:02:20.280 00:02:22.760
test your blood and figure it out but

00:02:23.070 00:02:24.800
with Parkinson's there's no blood test

00:02:25.170 00:02:28.490
or any tests like that they can use to

00:02:28.920 00:02:30.680
determine whether or not you have it so

00:02:30.870 00:02:34.040
it's done by observations and the

00:02:34.680 00:02:38.120
expertise of neurologists brain doctors

00:02:39.080 00:02:41.810
and Parkinson's is a it's a brain

00:02:42.320 00:02:44.650
disease your brain is no longer

00:02:45.660 00:02:48.050
producing normal amounts of certain

00:02:48.570 00:02:51.260
chemicals including dopamine and one of

00:02:51.420 00:02:55.340
the major functions of those chemicals

00:02:55.650 00:02:58.670
is it helps your brain communicate with

00:02:58.980 00:03:01.910
your muscles so you're not producing a

00:03:02.670 00:03:06.080
normal amount of those chemicals and so

00:03:06.270 00:03:08.480
it is a brain disease but it affects all

00:03:08.940 00:03:11.810
of your muscles all of your muscles

00:03:12.540 00:03:15.470
including your tongue but again that's

00:03:15.840 00:03:18.260
that's different for everybody my my

00:03:19.130 00:03:22.340
first notice that I have a tremor what

00:03:22.470 00:03:24.650
they call a head trauma I I call myself

00:03:24.990 00:03:27.710
a bobble head and in fact one of these

00:03:28.050 00:03:30.350
days when I get some land that's going

00:03:30.420 00:03:32.090
to be the name of my homestead the

00:03:32.490 00:03:35.120
bobble head homestead I like that and

00:03:35.459 00:03:37.070
then you know I can give away little

00:03:37.560 00:03:38.470
bobble head

00:03:39.480 00:03:42.050
farmers with a little bobble head

00:03:42.480 00:03:44.420
chicken next to it and that'd be kind of

00:03:44.490 00:03:46.940
fun but I'm dreaming off the top off the

00:03:47.400 00:03:49.310
subject I do that once in a while so

00:03:50.130 00:03:51.380
Parkinson's is a brain disease that

00:03:51.750 00:03:56.090
affects your the production of chemicals

00:03:56.250 00:03:57.500
in your brain those chemicals

00:03:58.470 00:04:00.949
communicate with your muscles so in my

00:04:01.020 00:04:04.240
case how it affects your muscles well it

00:04:05.250 00:04:09.350
it increases decreases your stamina so I

00:04:10.260 00:04:13.300
cannot stand up for eight hours a day

00:04:14.310 00:04:17.420
you know previous jobs I've well see I'm

00:04:17.549 00:04:18.979
going to give away all my random facts

00:04:19.290 00:04:20.920
in this one

00:04:21.859 00:04:25.600
that's okay previous jobs I've had to

00:04:25.850 00:04:27.879
stand up a lot and any job you have to

00:04:28.130 00:04:31.360
stand up a lot and that's just once if I

00:04:31.639 00:04:34.540
use a muscle for sometimes a minute

00:04:34.880 00:04:36.430
sometimes ten minutes sometimes 30

00:04:37.130 00:04:39.580
minutes it's all different and random it

00:04:40.250 00:04:43.870
just my my muscle will lock up kind of

00:04:44.060 00:04:46.779
like a kind of like a charley horse it

00:04:47.240 00:04:49.990
tenses up really tight and I've just got

00:04:50.120 00:04:52.120
to stop what I'm doing and hope that

00:04:52.340 00:04:54.129
that goes away sometimes it goes away in

00:04:54.199 00:04:56.980
a few seconds sometimes it'll stay for

00:04:57.560 00:05:01.510
four days or longer I had what really

00:05:01.789 00:05:03.430
sent me to the doctor the first time was

00:05:03.470 00:05:06.340
a neck cramp that did not go away and

00:05:07.190 00:05:12.330
now we know why the head tremor is

00:05:13.340 00:05:15.430
you're those muscles are working all the

00:05:15.470 00:05:18.400
time to hold your head up so because

00:05:19.039 00:05:20.589
it's working all the time I'm getting

00:05:20.930 00:05:22.749
the strain and the lack of chemicals

00:05:22.940 00:05:24.670
through those muscles so that causes the

00:05:25.250 00:05:25.960
head tremor

00:05:26.389 00:05:30.270
so my stamina as far as manual labor is

00:05:31.360 00:05:34.330
vastly reduced and there's just I might

00:05:34.490 00:05:36.370
have a good day where I can do a lot of

00:05:36.680 00:05:40.120
work and but then usually if I do a lot

00:05:40.250 00:05:42.670
of work the next day the next two days

00:05:43.099 00:05:46.360
next week I am I am in pain there is a

00:05:46.610 00:05:48.310
lot of pain involved I get a lot of

00:05:48.740 00:05:52.360
muscle spasms if I for example hold a

00:05:53.120 00:05:55.689
you know a gallon of milk which is eight

00:05:56.180 00:05:59.140
pounds if I hold that just too long some

00:05:59.180 00:06:01.210
of the muscles in my arm will start

00:06:01.880 00:06:03.490
spasming and just you know kind of like

00:06:03.710 00:06:05.399
that charley horse again where they're

00:06:06.409 00:06:10.920
contracting and it's it's painful my

00:06:11.930 00:06:14.770
life is a pain in the neck my neck is

00:06:15.110 00:06:18.879
always sore until I like I like chairs

00:06:19.130 00:06:21.279
with headrests maybe I'll get one of

00:06:22.230 00:06:25.880
these days let's see how you know that's

00:06:26.220 00:06:29.420
really the main effect and I get tired

00:06:29.580 00:06:33.620
very easily so you know even like mowing

00:06:33.750 00:06:35.270
the yard it might take a half an hour

00:06:35.700 00:06:38.600
but I'm wiped out at that point that

00:06:38.940 00:06:41.270
takes everything out of me and it takes

00:06:41.430 00:06:43.840
a little while for me to recover also

00:06:44.850 00:06:47.780
chronic fatigue is another symptom I

00:06:48.090 00:06:52.340
have to take a nap every day and those

00:06:52.770 00:06:54.920
naps are well and that interrupts my

00:06:55.320 00:06:56.870
sleep schedule which is another problem

00:06:57.570 00:06:59.150
with Parkinson's I may

00:06:59.550 00:07:01.340
you know I may go mow the yard and then

00:07:01.500 00:07:04.310
I'm dead tired I lay down for a nap and

00:07:04.830 00:07:07.310
six hours later I wake up and it's you

00:07:07.410 00:07:10.280
know ten o'clock at night and so my

00:07:10.860 00:07:14.600
sleep schedule is constantly altered not

00:07:14.670 00:07:18.410
a lot you can do about that let's see

00:07:18.870 00:07:21.830
what else how does it affect me

00:07:22.430 00:07:24.530
oh I'm sure I'll think of something

00:07:26.000 00:07:28.810
later let's see I am NOT on any type of

00:07:29.820 00:07:31.430
conventional medications I have never

00:07:31.950 00:07:33.350
taken any medicine for it

00:07:34.880 00:07:37.310
the typical routine you would go through

00:07:38.270 00:07:42.950
is first I saw a neurologist and a

00:07:43.680 00:07:45.830
multiple neurologist to get my diagnosis

00:07:46.230 00:07:47.420
because like I said it's an

00:07:49.970 00:07:54.080
observational prognosis and so I've lost

00:07:54.300 00:07:57.560
my train of thought again okay sorry

00:07:57.930 00:08:01.330
whatever a little interruption there um

00:08:02.340 00:08:04.610
where was I I have no clue where I'm not

00:08:04.830 00:08:06.980
on any type of conventional medications

00:08:07.560 00:08:10.670
so when you first go through your

00:08:11.720 00:08:14.750
diagnosis they typically they want to

00:08:15.360 00:08:17.570
scan your brain and your body to rule

00:08:17.790 00:08:19.730
out other diseases they're looking for

00:08:20.220 00:08:21.530
Elysian Zhan the brain or in the spine

00:08:22.290 00:08:24.860
they have to rule out MS they have to

00:08:25.110 00:08:28.279
rule out some type of brain tumor or

00:08:29.249 00:08:32.959
disruption in your brain that's one

00:08:33.209 00:08:35.329
thing head injuries head trauma is

00:08:35.820 00:08:37.399
another thing that can lead to

00:08:38.190 00:08:40.370
Parkinson's and in the case of Muhammad

00:08:40.500 00:08:43.430
Ali I think that was probably the case

00:08:43.979 00:08:49.129
I'm not a doctor so take that for what

00:08:49.709 00:08:54.439
it's worth so conventional medicines I

00:08:55.139 00:08:56.870
am NOT on any typically they're gonna

00:08:57.300 00:08:58.759
they're going to scan you

00:08:58.980 00:09:02.210
you know the MRI and the the cat scan or

00:09:03.029 00:09:04.569
whatever they do to rule out other

00:09:05.579 00:09:08.540
diseases and then they start you on the

00:09:09.360 00:09:12.199
medicine the drug dopamine synthetic

00:09:12.480 00:09:15.740
drug dopamine and that is that's only

00:09:16.199 00:09:18.170
one of the chemicals that your brain is

00:09:18.209 00:09:22.100
not producing enough of and if you ever

00:09:22.440 00:09:25.550
saw the movie awakenings with Robin

00:09:26.009 00:09:30.800
Williams and Robert DeNiro that is they

00:09:31.050 00:09:32.509
aren't talking about Parkinson's

00:09:33.089 00:09:35.030
patients in that movie but they that is

00:09:35.089 00:09:37.189
a movie of how they discovered

00:09:38.060 00:09:41.689
dopamine's effects on the brain and so

00:09:41.910 00:09:43.730
that would be the conventional treatment

00:09:43.980 00:09:46.910
would be to prescribe dopamine and then

00:09:47.190 00:09:49.960
also you know muscle relaxants

00:09:50.970 00:09:54.699
painkillers all of all your usual

00:09:55.709 00:09:57.650
volumes and percocets and whatever they

00:09:57.779 00:10:00.710
would also be prescribing those and I've

00:10:01.440 00:10:04.670
never taken any conventional medications

00:10:05.839 00:10:08.980
for Parkinson's one because it's really

00:10:10.980 00:10:14.840
you know it's my next my next doctor

00:10:15.360 00:10:17.090
visit just for the scans would be seven

00:10:17.399 00:10:19.759
grand and then they and then they

00:10:20.430 00:10:21.860
prescribe you the dopamine and you're

00:10:22.380 00:10:24.590
talking you know $200 a month to start

00:10:24.990 00:10:25.570
and it goes

00:10:25.790 00:10:27.580
from there the thing with the dopamine

00:10:28.070 00:10:31.750
pills is they wear off and you build up

00:10:31.940 00:10:34.630
a tolerance to them so you might start

00:10:34.880 00:10:37.360
off taking one pill every four hours and

00:10:38.360 00:10:40.390
a month later you're up to two pills

00:10:41.030 00:10:43.480
every four hours and then you know a

00:10:43.970 00:10:45.790
year later you're taking two pills an

00:10:45.950 00:10:48.670
hour and then the pills will stop

00:10:49.160 00:10:52.120
working they will stop working and so

00:10:52.970 00:10:55.750
for the younger onset Parkinson's

00:10:56.360 00:10:58.420
patients a lot of times they want you to

00:10:58.640 00:11:01.780
hold off taking the pills and just you

00:11:01.910 00:11:03.790
know deal with the pain and the side

00:11:06.010 00:11:08.200
effects without the medication because

00:11:08.750 00:11:12.220
it is going someday those pills are no

00:11:12.470 00:11:14.950
longer going to be effective and then at

00:11:15.140 00:11:19.750
that point the treatment is called deep

00:11:20.180 00:11:22.300
brain stimulation it's kind of like a

00:11:22.700 00:11:24.790
pacemaker for the heart but they put a

00:11:25.220 00:11:28.030
pacemaker in your brain and it sends

00:11:28.550 00:11:30.970
electric signals they put it in the part

00:11:31.040 00:11:33.010
of the brain that produces dopamine that

00:11:33.410 00:11:35.410
and those chemicals it sends an

00:11:36.020 00:11:37.180
electrical signal to that part of the

00:11:37.370 00:11:40.090
brain hoping to encourage it to produce

00:11:40.940 00:11:44.380
more of those chemicals and so deep

00:11:44.630 00:11:47.140
brain stimulation is that's kind of the

00:11:47.440 00:11:51.400
last resort and it's been successful at

00:11:51.950 00:11:54.880
improving a lot of lives there's some

00:11:55.100 00:11:57.580
people I know Michael J Fox has had it

00:11:57.800 00:12:00.700
at least once some people it doesn't

00:12:01.040 00:12:02.470
work the first time they have to go back

00:12:02.780 00:12:05.500
in for another brain surgery to do it

00:12:05.840 00:12:11.860
again and so yeah brain surgery but like

00:12:12.020 00:12:14.050
I said I'm not on any conventional

00:12:15.730 00:12:18.580
medications whatsoever for that I maybe

00:12:18.740 00:12:22.000
I will in the future I do not know but

00:12:22.340 00:12:24.310
one problem with not taking the

00:12:25.040 00:12:27.340
conventional medications is I am also

00:12:27.590 00:12:30.820
not on any type of welfare or disability

00:12:32.730 00:12:35.600
is so I'm kind of thinning for myself

00:12:35.820 00:12:37.550
out there I applied for Social Security

00:12:38.330 00:12:41.420
disability twice and was rejected their

00:12:42.390 00:12:43.699
requirements say you need to go through

00:12:44.160 00:12:46.610
six months worth of conventional

00:12:47.190 00:12:50.569
treatment before in order to prove that

00:12:51.000 00:12:53.269
the treatment does not work and you are

00:12:54.000 00:12:56.720
disabled so you know without being able

00:12:56.880 00:12:59.329
to spend 30 grand you can't prove to

00:12:59.519 00:13:01.460
them that you're disabled because some

00:13:01.860 00:13:04.040
people are diagnosed with Parkinson's

00:13:04.320 00:13:07.250
and they are able to go on working for

00:13:07.649 00:13:09.440
for several years with the conventional

00:13:10.110 00:13:14.180
medications and I worked after after my

00:13:15.149 00:13:17.569
diagnosis also for a while but so that's

00:13:17.910 00:13:19.840
the you know there's rules there's

00:13:20.850 00:13:22.819
regulations there's ends there's out so

00:13:23.779 00:13:26.870
no disability for you that's what they

00:13:27.120 00:13:30.230
said and and then and then when you're

00:13:30.269 00:13:32.569
not making enough money you're not

00:13:32.880 00:13:35.120
paying enough in Social Security taxes

00:13:35.430 00:13:36.769
and they throw you out of the system

00:13:37.140 00:13:38.930
because you're not you're not eligible

00:13:39.750 00:13:40.819
anymore because you haven't paid in

00:13:41.130 00:13:43.579
enough in the last five years that's a

00:13:43.800 00:13:44.630
whole other story

00:13:45.209 00:13:48.800
so yeah Parkinson's has really majorly

00:13:49.410 00:13:53.030
changed my life and in many ways as

00:13:53.399 00:13:57.610
you're may be seen from the random facts

00:13:58.620 00:14:01.100
that I've been sharing I was an active

00:14:01.470 00:14:03.829
youth and all the way through high

00:14:04.200 00:14:05.780
school and you'll find out in future

00:14:06.300 00:14:08.510
random facts I've always been active I'm

00:14:09.149 00:14:11.680
always involved in 20 different things

00:14:14.570 00:14:19.250
sports music other activities in college

00:14:19.470 00:14:23.689
and then after college in my my first

00:14:24.149 00:14:27.079
career I was very active long work hours

00:14:27.390 00:14:31.160
a lot of hard work and I did that all

00:14:31.320 00:14:34.910
the way up until my my late 30s I was

00:14:35.190 00:14:37.460
just always involved in in multiple

00:14:38.070 00:14:40.579
things and that Parkinson's puts a stop

00:14:40.649 00:14:41.470
to that you

00:14:41.630 00:14:43.689
got a I've got to sit down and take it

00:14:43.910 00:14:47.079
easy I just have to there's and if I

00:14:47.149 00:14:50.050
don't my legs will start the cramps and

00:14:50.839 00:14:53.980
the spasms and it'll force me to sit on

00:14:54.260 00:14:54.879
and take it easy

00:14:55.459 00:14:59.430
so that was a huge long adjustment

00:15:00.440 00:15:03.400
depression anxiety yeah you name it I

00:15:03.589 00:15:05.560
went through it all and I'm still going

00:15:05.720 00:15:10.360
through it all but okay before I get too

00:15:10.459 00:15:12.639
emotional here that is my Parkinson's

00:15:13.339 00:15:15.550
story you've got questions I'll be happy

00:15:15.769 00:15:18.819
