00:00:00.900 00:00:02.450
when I first received my diagnosis of

00:00:02.669 00:00:03.619
Parkinson's disease

00:00:04.230 00:00:05.539
needless to say I was a bit shocked and

00:00:06.020 00:00:08.740
surprised they got into the neurologists

00:00:09.750 00:00:11.360
think tank thinking I had part a carpal

00:00:11.610 00:00:13.220
tunnel syndrome and ended up coming out

00:00:13.349 00:00:15.490
with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease

00:00:16.500 00:00:19.220
basically rocked my world and I ended up

00:00:19.439 00:00:20.870
having so many questions go through my

00:00:21.060 00:00:24.200
head about why did I get this what did I

00:00:24.269 00:00:26.540
do to deserve this you know all normal

00:00:27.000 00:00:28.480
questions that you have when you face a

00:00:29.490 00:00:32.479
diagnosis like this but I surrounded

00:00:32.579 00:00:35.330
myself with people of faith and medical

00:00:35.820 00:00:37.430
professionals that I knew and family and

00:00:38.190 00:00:39.709
and we talked through through and

00:00:40.680 00:00:42.350
realized that this is something I needed

00:00:42.570 00:00:44.360
to embrace and that it wasn't gonna

00:00:44.489 00:00:46.760
change and I did have Parkinson's

00:00:47.100 00:00:49.940
disease and you know life it throwing me

00:00:49.980 00:00:52.819
a curveball and and I was on one path

00:00:53.250 00:00:55.069
and one journey and now I needed to go

00:00:55.800 00:00:58.220
make a new heading into a new journey in

00:00:58.350 00:01:01.189
a new direction and how I embraced that

00:01:02.750 00:01:06.020
was was by accepting it first of all and

00:01:06.900 00:01:08.090
realizing that God had a greater plan

00:01:08.430 00:01:10.640
for me and I didn't know about that I

00:01:10.950 00:01:15.109
needed to embrace this fully and carry

00:01:15.240 00:01:16.670
it through and figure out that whatever

00:01:17.220 00:01:21.039
purpose that God had for me I needed to

00:01:22.049 00:01:25.820
make the best of it so I did that I was

00:01:26.070 00:01:29.030
very positive and I quickly knew that

00:01:29.310 00:01:31.130
had a positive influence on people's

00:01:31.350 00:01:34.040
lives and I naturally am a cup is

00:01:34.170 00:01:36.320
overflowing kind of a person and that I

00:01:36.780 00:01:38.390
could help people and be a light and

00:01:39.300 00:01:41.660
give people hope and so through this

00:01:41.880 00:01:43.720
journey I hope I am able to do that

00:01:44.730 00:01:45.920
going through the emotions of the

00:01:46.680 00:01:48.080
diagnosis is normal for everyone for

00:01:48.480 00:01:50.800
whether it's frustration anger sadness

00:01:51.810 00:01:53.630
some people even go into depression and

00:01:55.280 00:01:57.530
so that's the direction I did not want

00:01:57.600 00:02:02.360
to go and so I have chosen to accept my

00:02:03.090 00:02:06.170
my my path and take on and take on a

00:02:06.330 00:02:08.000
very positive outlook I'm like as I

00:02:08.160 00:02:09.590
always have and continue that outlook

00:02:09.869 00:02:12.320
even with this diagnosis many people

00:02:12.450 00:02:13.580
don't even understand with Parkinson's

00:02:13.800 00:02:16.700
is and you know Parkinson's is people

00:02:16.890 00:02:18.350
that have tremors or they have

00:02:18.660 00:02:20.180
difficulty walking and they have gait

00:02:20.640 00:02:21.890
issues and they freeze when they walk

00:02:22.550 00:02:25.160
and so a lot of us educating people on

00:02:26.240 00:02:28.130
what Parkinson's is you know we take a

00:02:28.590 00:02:30.370
medication called levodopa carbidopa

00:02:31.380 00:02:33.650
which is something that helps us our

00:02:33.930 00:02:36.440
brain think we have dopamine and so when

00:02:36.660 00:02:37.850
we have too much of that in our system

00:02:38.280 00:02:40.940
we get what are called dyskinesia which

00:02:41.100 00:02:42.530
is a lot of the flailing you see in

00:02:42.930 00:02:44.640
people that

00:02:44.769 00:02:47.160
and control the movement of your body of

00:02:47.349 00:02:50.399
your limb so part of my process is I

00:02:50.470 00:02:52.020
think in this path is also to educate

00:02:52.510 00:02:55.320
people and help people become better

00:02:55.690 00:02:57.690
aware of what Parkinson's is the doctors

00:02:57.819 00:02:59.490
are doing so much in research right now

00:02:59.950 00:03:01.949
and there's so many positive things that

00:03:02.049 00:03:03.720
are coming up to the future that can

00:03:03.909 00:03:07.140
help people with this disease so I hope

00:03:07.329 00:03:10.170
I can help in that process
