00:00:01.709 00:00:02.840
hello and welcome to another YouTube

00:00:03.090 00:00:05.450
channel by dr. Matt PD my name is Andrew

00:00:05.609 00:00:06.980
Dean and I am a consultant geriatrician

00:00:07.020 00:00:09.379
and I've had Parkinson's disease for a

00:00:10.110 00:00:12.080
year and a half today I want to speak

00:00:12.179 00:00:13.850
about speech problems with Parkinson

00:00:14.040 00:00:15.919
disease and I hope this is helpful for

00:00:16.080 00:00:18.080
people with young onset Parkinson's

00:00:18.390 00:00:20.120
disease people with speech problems and

00:00:20.730 00:00:21.800
people who are caring for people with

00:00:22.439 00:00:25.099
Parkinson's disease speech problems are

00:00:25.230 00:00:27.019
not often spoken about but are very

00:00:27.269 00:00:29.570
helpful to be aware of because it can

00:00:29.880 00:00:32.600
have a lot of impact on people with

00:00:33.329 00:00:34.850
Parkinson's disease and there has been a

00:00:35.210 00:00:38.119
recent campaign by Parkinson's UK where

00:00:38.370 00:00:40.610
one of these stigma associated symptoms

00:00:40.950 00:00:43.459
that people get is because of the speech

00:00:43.829 00:00:45.680
problems they can appear so they sound

00:00:46.110 00:00:48.470
drunk with the other slurred words I

00:00:49.379 00:00:50.720
presently haven't had that problem so

00:00:50.809 00:00:52.760
much but I do have problem with my

00:00:53.960 00:00:56.000
speech this time last year I was

00:00:56.640 00:00:59.060
assessed by speech therapy who measured

00:00:59.399 00:01:01.340
my decibels and my clarity of my speech

00:01:02.210 00:01:06.560
and what they recorded was the decibels

00:01:06.810 00:01:09.200
of speech that I have recorded so the

00:01:09.600 00:01:11.450
normal speech is between 60 and 75

00:01:11.939 00:01:13.700
decibels and when I was assessed last

00:01:14.100 00:01:17.179
year my speech was between 55 and 60

00:01:17.430 00:01:20.210
three decibels so I could still be heard

00:01:20.700 00:01:23.899
but I was just quiet how did that affect

00:01:24.150 00:01:27.020
me well I was less confident I would

00:01:27.299 00:01:29.179
speak less I would have to wait for

00:01:29.310 00:01:31.399
other people to speak before I could

00:01:31.860 00:01:33.830
speak which is often well the problem I

00:01:34.140 00:01:36.560
suppose but when you're trying to get

00:01:36.869 00:01:38.600
across your point to a large group that

00:01:38.939 00:01:41.330
can be problematic so I suspect people

00:01:41.670 00:01:42.980
might struggle socially with this

00:01:43.470 00:01:44.780
because their speech is not good enough

00:01:45.450 00:01:48.889
they may just not speak at all for me it

00:01:49.259 00:01:50.539
affected my work and I'm sure a lot of

00:01:50.820 00:01:52.069
people with young onset Parkinson's

00:01:52.970 00:01:55.100
disease struggle with the work because

00:01:55.140 00:01:56.899
of their speech particularly if you have

00:01:57.149 00:01:59.929
to communicate over the phone where you

00:02:00.060 00:02:02.030
want to sound assertive you may end up

00:02:02.100 00:02:04.160
having to not you may not be able to

00:02:04.320 00:02:05.359
speak for as long as you would like

00:02:07.129 00:02:11.390
so speech can be improved and this is

00:02:11.550 00:02:13.369
where I want to focus on so speech

00:02:14.640 00:02:16.580
involves two main aspects one is the

00:02:17.219 00:02:19.099
medications because the dopamine in the

00:02:19.200 00:02:21.319
brain being low does cause speech

00:02:21.780 00:02:23.449
problems because speech is produced by

00:02:23.519 00:02:25.190
the muscles of the vocal cords the

00:02:25.469 00:02:27.830
tongue the lips the mouth and therefore

00:02:28.650 00:02:29.720
coordination of the muscles is required

00:02:30.090 00:02:32.690
to speak clearly so if your dopamine

00:02:33.150 00:02:34.759
others are low will gobble people with

00:02:35.340 00:02:36.170
Parkinson's disease then you're going to

00:02:36.420 00:02:38.360
struggle with that and so therefore

00:02:39.530 00:02:41.959
dopamine medications like l-dopa are

00:02:43.129 00:02:45.409
helpful the other aspect is speech

00:02:45.930 00:02:46.729
therapy with the speech and language

00:02:47.250 00:02:48.800
therapy team otherwise known as assault

00:02:49.079 00:02:52.970
team they are really helpful for helping

00:02:53.010 00:02:55.039
with communication all they did was

00:02:55.500 00:02:57.259
imagine about decimals and they referred

00:02:57.299 00:02:59.330
me on for the Lee Silverman speech

00:02:59.870 00:03:02.689
therapy course and I would highly

00:03:02.730 00:03:04.459
recommend anybody with young onset

00:03:05.159 00:03:06.679
Parkinson's disease or people with

00:03:06.959 00:03:08.959
speech problems and Parkinson's to be

00:03:09.480 00:03:11.559
referred for speech therapy assessment

00:03:12.569 00:03:14.750
the Lee Silverman therapy does work and

00:03:15.120 00:03:17.689
it focus on making people louder it is

00:03:17.909 00:03:21.349
an exercise regime and people miss often

00:03:23.359 00:03:25.909
and don't realize quite how important to

00:03:26.040 00:03:28.580
the year we the exercises are so you'd

00:03:28.799 00:03:30.710
be given exercises twice a day for four

00:03:30.750 00:03:33.229
weeks I'd have three one-hour sessions

00:03:33.509 00:03:36.469
per week and that can be quite a big

00:03:37.040 00:03:39.110
commitment but if you do commit to it it

00:03:39.449 00:03:41.439
does pay off what you put into it does

00:03:42.449 00:03:44.719
come back to you with dividends so I did

00:03:44.909 00:03:46.729
that and my speech is now a hundred

00:03:47.040 00:03:49.460
percent in the normal range rather than

00:03:49.859 00:03:52.490
thirty percent so my voice is now pretty

00:03:52.650 00:03:53.509
much back to how it was before

00:03:54.449 00:03:55.670
Parkinson's disease and certainly my

00:03:56.220 00:03:57.259
confidence levels with my speech is

00:03:57.659 00:04:00.679
improve the exercise is just so you have

00:04:00.840 00:04:02.229
an idea of what you're going to be doing

00:04:03.239 00:04:05.479
focuses on and they're having an

00:04:06.030 00:04:08.330
improved volume and quality of the

00:04:08.939 00:04:11.719
speech while they say don't shout but to

00:04:11.969 00:04:14.809
try and speak loudly as a thing loud and

00:04:15.150 00:04:17.719
speak loud is very much emphasized they

00:04:18.389 00:04:20.300
often will focus on the change of the

00:04:20.579 00:04:23.450
tone go for a low to a high ah ah and

00:04:23.669 00:04:25.930
we're from a high to a low ah

00:04:26.150 00:04:28.650
as well as trying to maintain a loud R

00:04:29.660 00:04:31.750
which you will be getting used to doing

00:04:32.330 00:04:34.390
it sounds a bit funny so you may prefer

00:04:34.550 00:04:37.090
to do it when in privacy so I did it

00:04:37.220 00:04:38.440
when I was in my car on the way to work

00:04:38.630 00:04:40.210
on the way I'm back from work I do my

00:04:41.050 00:04:44.200
lab exercises and then I'm going to do

00:04:44.360 00:04:46.330
different exercises whilst you're at the

00:04:46.790 00:04:49.480
lessons and it works so please be

00:04:49.880 00:04:52.600
referred early so people young as a

00:04:53.150 00:04:54.700
Parkinson's disease I highly recommend

00:04:55.850 00:04:57.250
of course there are other aspects

00:04:57.550 00:04:59.410
regarding communication the facial

00:04:59.960 00:05:01.810
expression can be affected as well as

00:05:02.020 00:05:04.990
the understanding of the cognition

00:05:05.750 00:05:07.390
aspect so you can go word finding

00:05:07.790 00:05:09.520
difficulties later on with Parkinson's

00:05:09.800 00:05:11.560
disease and but today I wanted to really

00:05:11.810 00:05:13.270
focus on the young onset Parkinson's

00:05:13.520 00:05:15.670
disease patients because I think if

00:05:16.010 00:05:18.550
you're aware of the speech problem but

00:05:18.650 00:05:21.430
you're not sure what to do seek referral

00:05:21.590 00:05:22.840
for the speech therapy team they will

00:05:23.210 00:05:24.610
help you

00:05:25.490 00:05:29.290
so it works get referred early so that's

00:05:29.420 00:05:30.760
a bit on speech clearly if there's

00:05:30.950 00:05:32.380

my aim is to get a series of videos on a

00:05:52.340 00:05:53.620
lot of topics that are not necessarily
