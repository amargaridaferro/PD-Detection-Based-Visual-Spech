00:00:00.690 00:00:03.230
hey everybody uh so I told you I would

00:00:03.270 00:00:06.470
let you know how I was doing on the 24

00:00:06.810 00:00:10.040
hour water fast well it is the next day

00:00:10.410 00:00:14.959
and I am doing amazing like I'm not

00:00:15.179 00:00:16.430
kidding you I thought I would be

00:00:17.039 00:00:20.570
exhausted I thought I would be hungry I

00:00:21.000 00:00:22.609
thought the worst of the worst and I

00:00:22.800 00:00:24.800
wasn't gonna be able to function ever

00:00:25.380 00:00:27.230
since doing that pink Himalayan a flush

00:00:27.660 00:00:30.380
and doing this 24-hour fast of just

00:00:30.900 00:00:35.450
water I have had the most energy doing

00:00:35.820 00:00:37.840
this that I have felt in a long time I

00:00:38.850 00:00:42.440
felt amazing so I just have to say there

00:00:42.600 00:00:44.090
is no doubt after doing this

00:00:45.030 00:00:46.670
experiencing it I would recommend this

00:00:46.739 00:00:48.920
for anybody the only things I was

00:00:49.410 00:00:51.380
feeling was I had the chills a lot which

00:00:51.420 00:00:53.840
was really interesting I just felt

00:00:54.030 00:00:57.200
really cold and I had the chills but the

00:00:57.510 00:00:58.700
water and everything I felt really

00:00:59.399 00:01:01.400
hydrated I felt really good I felt

00:01:02.059 00:01:05.060
energized really didn't have any side

00:01:05.430 00:01:07.370
effects from it again the only thing I

00:01:07.590 00:01:09.230
think I felt was just the chills on me

00:01:09.390 00:01:12.710
and I don't know what that was um yeah

00:01:13.049 00:01:14.480
so I highly recommend it to anybody

00:01:15.000 00:01:16.249
especially if you're dealing with any

00:01:16.470 00:01:18.140
kind of illness if you're dealing with

00:01:18.330 00:01:19.550
things like Lyme disease or Parkinson's

00:01:20.189 00:01:23.300
you take medication in line you know

00:01:23.490 00:01:24.740
you're killing bacteria if you're

00:01:25.140 00:01:26.359
treating at home if you're treating with

00:01:26.460 00:01:28.399
the antibiotics either way you're

00:01:28.740 00:01:30.469
killing bacteria and that bacteria is

00:01:31.439 00:01:32.990
living within your system or not living

00:01:33.119 00:01:34.730
but it's it's circulating throughout

00:01:34.799 00:01:35.270
your system

00:01:35.759 00:01:37.160
you've got to flush that out as quickly

00:01:37.380 00:01:39.410
as possible and then you if you have

00:01:39.630 00:01:41.450
Lyme you know what a Herk's is that's

00:01:41.640 00:01:43.630
when you have an extreme reaction to

00:01:44.640 00:01:46.969
bacteria die off so if you are treating

00:01:47.369 00:01:49.700
Lyme disease and you have those horses a

00:01:49.860 00:01:52.249
lot if you feel really bad all the time

00:01:52.439 00:01:55.370
I highly recommend for you to take in

00:01:56.540 00:01:57.889
consideration listen to your conscience

00:01:58.290 00:01:59.600
and say you know something's going on

00:01:59.909 00:02:01.760
and I need to release these toxins I

00:02:01.950 00:02:03.709
need to get this stuff out of me and the

00:02:03.899 00:02:05.060
one thing I would highly recommend is

00:02:05.100 00:02:08.749
that Himalayan Himalayan salt flush and

00:02:09.420 00:02:10.609
give your body a break if your body

00:02:10.890 00:02:12.170
needs a break give it a break we never

00:02:12.420 00:02:12.930
give it a break

00:02:13.240 00:02:14.280
we're eating all the time we're drinking

00:02:14.560 00:02:15.810
all the time we're taking meds we're

00:02:16.570 00:02:19.170
Lilla our systems constantly going just

00:02:19.390 00:02:21.930
let it rest let it rest for 24 hours and

00:02:22.030 00:02:23.910
you would feel amazing you could do this

00:02:24.220 00:02:26.490
once a month if not do it every season

00:02:27.040 00:02:29.750
you don't have to do it all the time so

00:02:30.760 00:02:32.640
highly recommended I really enjoyed it

00:02:33.010 00:02:34.440

00:02:34.510 00:02:37.200
