00:00:03.149 00:00:04.309
everything about you here about

00:00:04.940 00:00:08.360
Parkinson's is that it just you know it

00:00:08.519 00:00:10.759
just keeps going and it just keeps

00:00:11.010 00:00:12.860
making different parts of your body not

00:00:13.380 00:00:14.600
function and you lose control of the

00:00:14.849 00:00:18.590
nerves and everything and I thought CBD

00:00:18.750 00:00:20.570
with all the research was the answer but

00:00:21.180 00:00:23.120
then when it didn't work I was really

00:00:23.580 00:00:26.240
continuous not sure where to go this was

00:00:26.609 00:00:29.689
my last my last hope this is how I woke

00:00:29.880 00:00:31.400
up this morning this is how it usually

00:00:32.239 00:00:37.220
is I'm going to take my little pill that

00:00:37.380 00:00:38.119
you're not going to be able to me

00:00:38.430 00:00:40.340
because my hands are shaking so badly

00:00:40.770 00:00:42.920
but there's just a tiny kind of drop in

00:00:44.899 00:00:47.479
there medicine and I thank God that it

00:00:47.700 00:00:50.360
worked because it has just amazingly you

00:00:50.550 00:00:52.010
could just be able to calm this women

00:00:52.140 00:00:53.450
with the first dose within the first

00:00:53.670 00:00:55.310
hour I can feel the calm come over me

00:00:55.559 00:00:59.240
and the hand stops shaking so it's been

00:00:59.340 00:01:01.099
about a half an hour since I took my

00:01:01.410 00:01:05.700

00:01:06.710 00:01:09.070
