00:00:06.069 00:00:15.749
my name is eros Breslin my diagnosis

00:00:15.880 00:00:18.120
with diagnosis of with Parkinson's was a

00:00:18.310 00:00:21.200
bit of a roller coaster actually I I

00:00:22.210 00:00:24.570
fixed this noticed my little finger on

00:00:25.090 00:00:27.540
my left hand but was this this is so he

00:00:27.880 00:00:30.540
was when he was shaking and lettuce

00:00:31.330 00:00:33.299
six six months later that what my

00:00:33.670 00:00:35.610
writing is not doing it so oh wait I

00:00:35.860 00:00:38.580
thought I thought it's to create a way

00:00:38.890 00:00:43.650
to see a GP and the director here oldest

00:00:44.200 00:00:48.090
and I'm I don't inject money into it and

00:00:48.250 00:00:51.690
and googled him and I I I thought it was

00:00:52.239 00:00:57.150
Parkinson's and and expected in your own

00:00:58.170 00:01:02.400
time along with my way changes party

00:01:02.890 00:01:05.870
after this because he told me he said

00:01:06.880 00:01:08.399
what do you think yeah that's it I think

00:01:08.470 00:01:09.240
I have Parkinsons

00:01:09.369 00:01:11.670
I guess he turned around zippy Aaron you

00:01:12.130 00:01:17.969
100% you do not have part of it except

00:01:18.130 00:01:19.140
six months later now in that scene

00:01:19.420 00:01:20.219
because you're us mean I think you have

00:01:28.890 00:01:32.280
parties i I think I think he was of the

00:01:32.590 00:01:36.890
he was of the age of before people

00:01:37.900 00:01:39.870
before young onset pumpkins we became

00:01:40.210 00:01:56.660
such a big well-known possibility and

00:01:57.670 00:02:01.889
and I once I went to went to King's

00:02:02.140 00:02:04.770
College to to help out with a medical

00:02:05.259 00:02:09.090
exams and I was always the oversleep

00:02:09.970 00:02:13.260
temper temptation and and one was what

00:02:13.540 00:02:15.119
no nobody that nobody gets that were

00:02:18.069 00:02:22.110
blamin but but one girl when she took me

00:02:22.510 00:02:24.270
went that the wind was with a mountain

00:02:24.310 00:02:28.140
that done and when she went and said

00:02:28.180 00:02:30.869
that I have partisans she was like this

00:02:31.090 00:02:40.710
girl me quite funny it was a good listen

00:02:40.840 00:02:54.949
for as well she made a lot today and

00:02:55.959 00:03:00.509
used to promote awareness of Parkinson's

00:03:01.239 00:03:02.580
you make these really cool little videos

00:03:03.489 00:03:04.979
we actually had your Christmas song on

00:03:05.110 00:03:07.890
our Christmas playlist which is quite an

00:03:08.049 00:03:09.119
honor because my dad doesn't let

00:03:09.400 00:03:10.710
anything go on to that playlist so you

00:03:11.200 00:03:13.380
should be honored there I feel very

00:03:13.660 00:03:29.610
humbled to be part of you boys done some

00:03:29.799 00:03:33.000
form of singing since I was about that

00:03:33.639 00:03:38.460
17 18 maybe but um it was purely a

00:03:39.190 00:03:44.789
karaoke kind of thing in and it wasn't

00:03:45.010 00:03:47.099
it was until I came to England that I

00:03:47.620 00:03:50.580
started trying with music and and and

00:03:51.099 00:03:54.089
then like I taught myself how to write

00:03:54.220 00:03:58.409
music and went to the process of not

00:03:58.660 00:04:00.180
having to be blind not having to having

00:04:00.250 00:04:01.440
to be reliant on other thing or other

00:04:02.160 00:04:06.240
people's and the ladies right if it

00:04:06.430 00:04:08.880
makes it

00:04:08.920 00:04:10.200
I think they're brilliant they're really

00:04:10.450 00:04:11.850
funny at times they're really poignant

00:04:12.190 00:04:13.470
all the time so you're very kind of

00:04:13.830 00:04:16.050
writer thank you and they tend to rhyme

00:04:16.299 00:04:22.500
as well which is one of the bizarre

00:04:22.810 00:04:32.640
things about Parkinson's and you can

00:04:45.810 00:04:48.210
sing it can't rap just through just to

00:04:49.210 00:04:51.659
normal life really uh what my speech my

00:04:51.970 00:04:55.140
speech got became became but we can be

00:04:55.660 00:04:57.170
progressively progressively worse and

00:04:58.180 00:05:01.860
and and that my my walking got worse as

00:05:02.020 00:05:06.780
well and and and but I know this on the

00:05:07.090 00:05:08.400
condition when I had to wrangle of

00:05:08.800 00:05:10.820
Brussels at angle I could run

00:05:11.830 00:05:14.340
normally it was it's strange as as I

00:05:14.590 00:05:15.870
said in my song it's bizarre how I can

00:05:16.290 00:05:20.370
remember that catwalk at monkey insane

00:05:20.530 00:05:26.810
but can't talk and and it's a it's like

00:05:27.820 00:05:28.620
running I think I think it's just the

00:05:29.020 00:05:31.140
automation it's that it's that it's one

00:05:31.270 00:05:35.010
after the other it's like is it it's

00:05:35.169 00:05:39.110
like it's like walking to a beat it

00:05:40.120 00:05:41.550
they've proven that paper people won't

00:05:41.770 00:05:44.190
made it to a beat then it's nothing at

00:05:44.260 00:05:52.080
all and and and I think Tamara I if I'm

00:05:52.240 00:05:53.219
having trouble walking on walking

00:05:53.680 00:05:56.040
walking foot path I look at the squares

00:05:56.350 00:05:58.920
and I walk ok trying to take into

00:05:59.380 00:06:08.820
squares every two squares at the time he

00:06:09.550 00:06:11.460
sees me out as well but singing singing

00:06:11.650 00:06:14.340
wise singing wise it's more of a it's

00:06:14.590 00:06:19.680
more of a beat I got one two three four

00:06:20.050 00:06:21.810
again it's the same walking it's it's

00:06:22.300 00:06:22.559
same pretty

00:06:22.659 00:06:25.799
- was walking I think it it's the beat

00:06:25.990 00:06:42.460
it keeps you going and and the flow and

00:07:13.749 00:07:33.689
when we left me and this one is gray I

00:07:34.300 00:07:37.529
was fortunate to get to go to Glasgow

00:07:38.439 00:07:44.839
back in 2010 thing was

00:07:45.849 00:07:53.790
1310 yeah 2010 and then again that

00:07:54.339 00:07:55.980
Congress was a turning point in my life

00:07:56.610 00:07:59.309
because up till then I pretty much I

00:07:59.619 00:08:01.369
pretty much get my head in the sand and

00:08:02.379 00:08:04.230
not dealt with Parkinson's and just

00:08:04.569 00:08:08.759
denied it and I admit Tom's to act he

00:08:09.039 00:08:12.389
and Thea's before that Tom Isaacs and he

00:08:13.389 00:08:15.869
it was Tom that encouraged me to go to

00:08:16.659 00:08:18.749
encourage me and go to the Congress and

00:08:19.360 00:08:22.379
I did and we're going yeah I mean I met

00:08:22.599 00:08:25.170
John Stanford a minute Sarah Gary Vicki

00:08:25.659 00:08:27.749
Dylan I mean loads of people or people

00:08:27.909 00:08:33.990
all these people that are now it became

00:08:34.089 00:08:36.220
my friends in and you know

00:08:36.350 00:08:39.730
so and also my like my support network

00:08:40.160 00:08:41.950
and I became there's and it's you know

00:08:42.740 00:08:45.850
it's it's it's a it was it wasn't it was

00:08:46.040 00:08:48.070
a huge tour it my life it wasn't that it

00:08:48.710 00:08:53.080
wasn't that Congress then I we still

00:08:53.180 00:09:06.490
have my head in the sand but once you

00:09:06.650 00:09:07.480
get used to it you realize that

00:09:08.030 00:09:09.070
everybody is the person everyone's

00:09:09.440 00:09:10.330
dealing with their own condition in

00:09:10.460 00:09:11.740
their own way and actually we all need

00:09:11.870 00:09:13.770
to support each other it's niqua to be

00:09:14.780 00:09:16.000
exciting experience to kind of feel like

00:09:16.520 00:09:17.950
you don't have to explain yourself for a

00:09:18.110 00:09:32.580
week after it's almost a relief isn't it

00:09:33.590 00:09:34.810
sorry I've got Parkinson's and they just

00:09:35.030 00:09:42.850
look to me like why is it why is it so

00:09:46.690 00:10:01.500
different in the gfg DMS drop it was

00:10:02.510 00:10:06.250
okay I'm gonna try and tell you what

00:10:06.560 00:10:09.100
matters band for Lyle cell derived

00:10:09.530 00:10:15.190
neurotropic factor and and and it's a

00:10:15.410 00:10:17.980
it's basically a protein which is found

00:10:18.230 00:10:22.300
in the brain it and this project it it

00:10:23.030 00:10:25.450
rebuild me those neurons and what was it

00:10:25.610 00:10:27.250
done is that they found a way of the way

00:10:27.910 00:10:32.710
of creating the GD net and putting it in

00:10:32.840 00:10:38.050
the brain for a delivery system um

00:10:38.840 00:10:46.210
you're gonna see it do you see it

00:10:46.490 00:10:49.240
yeah my point that that goes that Pete

00:10:49.490 00:10:51.850
yeah up to the top of my head into

00:10:52.220 00:10:54.280
thought into for port into for tubes and

00:10:54.590 00:10:56.410
to going with deep my brain it to go in

00:10:56.600 00:10:59.740
there and and it delivers it delivers

00:10:59.780 00:11:03.130
the I'm the gdf tiny amount

00:11:03.680 00:11:05.920
tiny management what once was it was

00:11:06.170 00:11:09.070
once a month wait and try was on and

00:11:09.380 00:11:12.460
then we leave it to the Judy Huth

00:11:13.010 00:11:16.810
kutiman or I think it's called and it

00:11:17.450 00:11:19.660
all I can say is it was work okay it

00:11:19.850 00:11:22.210
made a messy difference to me and and

00:11:22.490 00:11:26.170
and and it I think it's a shame how

00:11:26.600 00:11:29.770
visor have turned around it and and and

00:11:31.690 00:11:36.210
stop working to try and and cure

00:11:37.220 00:11:52.440
Parkinson's and Alzheimer's so shame or

00:11:53.450 00:11:56.160
memories when I was back in 2004 and

00:11:57.170 00:12:01.110
that's nearly 13 years ago

00:12:03.370 00:12:28.950
thanks like I said I'm not first of all

00:12:29.960 00:12:31.420
look at in your noses partners and think

00:12:31.550 00:12:32.470
I think that's how you're gonna be

00:12:32.780 00:12:34.870
because you you will most definitely be

00:12:35.330 00:12:38.260
different in right now I I met I met

00:12:39.200 00:12:40.660
hundreds and hundreds of people with bad

00:12:41.300 00:12:44.890
others and and and and I can think of

00:12:45.080 00:12:46.690
probably one person they have similar

00:12:47.120 00:12:50.560
similar Parkinson's to me that that's a

00:12:51.650 00:12:56.370
there's hundreds it it's it's an

00:12:57.380 00:12:58.000
populous is very

00:12:59.620 00:14:46.930
and it's like and it's like Oh God

00:14:58.430 00:15:00.160
thank you um did

00:15:00.529 00:15:02.590
there is one under tape no I'd like to

00:15:03.700 00:15:08.410
share as and I was like I bet back it

00:15:08.660 00:15:13.389
back it - in 2006 table and I was always

00:15:13.730 00:15:15.790
filming for the Deer Park you park in

00:15:15.890 00:15:19.960
this dress doing kitchen tricks wrong

00:15:20.500 00:15:23.949
and and I mean well and it won't fellow

00:15:24.140 00:15:26.230
called Alan Jack awaits he gave me some

00:15:26.360 00:15:31.570
really funny he's fallen right it it it

00:15:32.390 00:15:34.420
it's it's the way you eat but it's when

00:15:34.459 00:15:37.780
you get frozen and they pick people

00:15:38.480 00:15:39.730
people when they get frozen they try

00:15:39.890 00:15:41.290
they try to walk forward but that's the

00:15:41.420 00:15:42.220
wrong thing you should try to walk

00:15:43.060 00:15:45.490
sideways it's much easier to get out of

00:15:45.620 00:15:47.949
it and he sees tickets to do The Wizard

00:15:48.020 00:16:03.610
of Oz right and it works with thanks

00:16:14.360 00:16:18.070
can you hear the way that I talk it has

00:17:44.309 00:17:45.940
we suffer
