00:00:00.210 00:00:02.360
it's casual Friday I'm going to update

00:00:02.820 00:00:05.869
you on my finished objects and finish it

00:00:06.390 00:00:08.600
February and I'm going to talk a bit

00:00:08.760 00:00:12.680
about knitting reference books

00:00:13.690 00:00:15.329
just like on technique Tuesdays I've got

00:00:15.580 00:00:17.010
links down in the description if you

00:00:17.110 00:00:18.749
would like to jump right to a specific

00:00:19.360 00:00:22.650
point in the video so I have an

00:00:22.990 00:00:24.510
announcement to make a question to

00:00:24.700 00:00:27.450
answer an update on my finish at

00:00:28.080 00:00:30.599
February projects and then I'll talk

00:00:31.769 00:00:36.209
about knitting reference books

00:00:37.079 00:00:40.020
so announcements so I have an article in

00:00:40.809 00:00:42.180
the current issue of interweave knits

00:00:43.030 00:00:45.209
winter - no it's not winter it's spring

00:00:45.489 00:00:47.479
it just feels like winter because it's

00:00:48.489 00:00:52.829
20 below outside it's the spring 2018

00:00:53.229 00:00:54.899
issue of interweave knits and I have an

00:00:55.479 00:00:59.009
article on stranded colorwork and gauge

00:00:59.769 00:01:00.689
issues that you can have when

00:01:01.510 00:01:03.899
transitioning between swaths of plain

00:01:04.239 00:01:05.850
stockinette and then stranded colorwork

00:01:07.080 00:01:10.620
so it covers both issues with technique

00:01:10.960 00:01:13.350
that you might have as well as just what

00:01:13.479 00:01:15.660
are the structural differences between a

00:01:16.659 00:01:18.480
regular stockinette and then stranded

00:01:18.640 00:01:20.999
colorwork stockinette that causes gauge

00:01:21.640 00:01:22.649
differences and then how you can adjust

00:01:23.140 00:01:26.190
for that so if you're interested I'll

00:01:26.440 00:01:29.279
put a picture of the cover right up here

00:01:29.500 00:01:31.950
so that you can identify it and you can

00:01:32.170 00:01:33.990
get a lot of yarn chops carrying

00:01:34.360 00:01:37.169
interweave knits but I think Bernsen why

00:01:37.450 00:01:39.690
no Barnes &amp; Noble does I assume other

00:01:40.420 00:01:41.820
bookstores that carry a number of

00:01:42.009 00:01:44.279
magazines would carry it and then you

00:01:44.440 00:01:46.800
can also buy it directly from interweave

00:01:46.840 00:01:49.499
knits either in hard copy form or in as

00:01:49.539 00:01:53.450
a digital download

00:01:54.420 00:01:56.360
so this week in the finish at February

00:01:56.910 00:01:59.270
thread in my Ravelry group rocks rocks

00:02:00.150 00:02:02.090
somebody posted a photo of a cowl that

00:02:02.490 00:02:04.460
she had woven the ensign she'd been

00:02:04.650 00:02:07.160
wearing it for a while she wore I think

00:02:07.380 00:02:08.900
over Christmas or something with the

00:02:09.300 00:02:10.910
ends hanging down and she wondered if

00:02:11.220 00:02:13.190
anyone else does that so I want to I

00:02:13.470 00:02:15.530
want to show you something I took it out

00:02:15.630 00:02:17.810
of the back of my cupboard this is a

00:02:18.660 00:02:22.640
sweater that I knit years ago it's a

00:02:23.480 00:02:27.020
v-neck sweater with color work and it

00:02:27.150 00:02:28.640
was one of those patterns where I saw

00:02:28.709 00:02:30.890
the photo and I wanted to make exactly

00:02:31.910 00:02:34.310
that sweater in those colors with that

00:02:34.980 00:02:37.040
yarn so I did that

00:02:37.370 00:02:40.400
and I could have used my article on

00:02:40.920 00:02:42.140
stranded colorwork from the looks of

00:02:42.300 00:02:46.400
this but had a lot of ends to weave in

00:02:48.410 00:02:50.600
because this is actually more of an

00:02:51.000 00:02:53.660
intership pattern than a stranded

00:02:53.820 00:02:54.830
colorwork pattern because there's only

00:02:55.560 00:02:57.470
stranding across bits of it and then

00:02:57.660 00:03:01.190
there's big spans of plain stockinette

00:03:01.920 00:03:05.360
so um there were lots of ends to weave

00:03:05.640 00:03:08.440
in so I did really well in the front

00:03:09.450 00:03:12.710
weaving in ends then you'll see the

00:03:13.049 00:03:15.890
sleeve has quite a few and this sleeve

00:03:16.290 00:03:20.570
has quite a few and then the back has a

00:03:20.940 00:03:22.789
lot also so I just got tired of weaving

00:03:22.890 00:03:25.460
in ends and and left it there so I

00:03:26.160 00:03:27.440
haven't worn this recently it was in the

00:03:27.600 00:03:30.620
back of my cupboard but I do remember

00:03:31.080 00:03:32.360
when I used to wear it because some of

00:03:32.580 00:03:34.759
these ends see how they extend past the

00:03:35.130 00:03:37.789
cuff that I would tuck them back up

00:03:38.280 00:03:39.410
inside I don't know why I didn't just

00:03:39.690 00:03:41.900
trim them shorter but so yeah I

00:03:42.420 00:03:44.030
sometimes wear things without weaving in

00:03:44.070 00:03:49.530
the ends so that answers that question

00:03:50.540 00:03:53.440
so onto finished objects so I have three

00:03:54.580 00:03:56.410
completed projects for this week and

00:03:56.900 00:03:59.020
then I have a sub project that I

00:03:59.480 00:04:00.699
completed I talked about that last week

00:04:01.040 00:04:03.309
how with big projects sometimes I break

00:04:03.650 00:04:05.350
things down into smaller sub projects

00:04:05.930 00:04:08.140
that I can feel like I'm making progress

00:04:09.080 00:04:10.270
so that's what I'm going to share with

00:04:10.459 00:04:14.170
you now so the first thing I finished

00:04:14.480 00:04:16.780
was a pair of socks with the blue

00:04:17.480 00:04:19.180
contrast heel I did a peasant heel again

00:04:19.790 00:04:23.280
these socks were also one of those

00:04:24.290 00:04:26.550
projects I was working on when I was

00:04:27.560 00:04:29.710
figuring out how to make peasant heels

00:04:29.930 00:04:33.240
that would fit people in my family and I

00:04:34.250 00:04:36.219
them in up in a video I probably the

00:04:36.440 00:04:38.530
first video about peasant heels and

00:04:38.720 00:04:40.060
short road heels and getting them to fit

00:04:40.220 00:04:43.090
and now I'll link that up there and I

00:04:43.400 00:04:45.100
used these socks in there because one of

00:04:45.290 00:04:48.790
these I did an afterthought heel where I

00:04:49.100 00:04:51.700
did not mark where the heel is going to

00:04:51.830 00:04:54.490
be in tell head knit most of the foot

00:04:54.680 00:04:56.620
and then I figured out where where I

00:04:57.080 00:04:59.380
wanted to heel the hit and then in the

00:04:59.900 00:05:01.750
second one I did a forethought heel

00:05:01.940 00:05:02.980
which is what a lot of people call it

00:05:03.590 00:05:04.870
afterthought heel but it's actually

00:05:05.120 00:05:06.219
you're actually thinking about it ahead

00:05:06.350 00:05:08.409
of time where I placed waste yarn at the

00:05:09.200 00:05:10.330
location where I wanted to heal so I did

00:05:10.669 00:05:13.510
want to each just do that because what I

00:05:13.669 00:05:16.510
had wanted to do was split this kind of

00:05:16.789 00:05:19.150
black and white section in half exactly

00:05:19.280 00:05:20.500
and I didn't know where it was going to

00:05:20.539 00:05:22.450
end when I was knitting the first one so

00:05:22.729 00:05:24.909
that's the one that I made as a true

00:05:25.640 00:05:28.090
afterthought heel and I said I liked him

00:05:28.729 00:05:30.640
and I needed to do both the heels and

00:05:30.740 00:05:32.710
the toes I wanted to do the heels before

00:05:32.780 00:05:34.450
I did that chose make sure I got in the

00:05:35.229 00:05:38.230
length completely correct and I like

00:05:38.390 00:05:38.770
these a lot

00:05:38.960 00:05:41.200
I don't I probably again will send these

00:05:41.390 00:05:43.960
to my mother because I have so many

00:05:44.330 00:05:46.450
socks I can't put them in my drawer okay

00:05:46.669 00:05:49.180
so the second thing that I finished was

00:05:50.380 00:05:54.360
a reversibly cabled scarf this is the

00:05:55.370 00:05:58.300
item I added to my UFO pile last week

00:05:59.030 00:06:00.550
when I realized I hadn't woman in the

00:06:00.800 00:06:02.380
ends or washed and blocked it so

00:06:02.510 00:06:06.160
this is a pattern that I have on Ravelry

00:06:06.290 00:06:07.900
it's my very first pattern it's probably

00:06:08.090 00:06:10.990
10 11 years old and I will be rewriting

00:06:11.440 00:06:15.880
it reformatting it next month the enemy

00:06:16.280 00:06:17.470
March going to be catching up on

00:06:18.260 00:06:20.530
patterns so it's you know so I'm both

00:06:20.780 00:06:25.150
it's on both sides it has the xoxo cable

00:06:25.720 00:06:28.330
pattern on both sides so whatever looks

00:06:28.490 00:06:30.610
like an X on this side looks like an O

00:06:30.860 00:06:35.470
on that side so that's the second thing

00:06:35.630 00:06:38.890
and then the third thing is I think it's

00:06:39.020 00:06:40.960
the old yeah it's the oldest thing in

00:06:41.300 00:06:43.600
this particular pile so these are some

00:06:44.030 00:06:46.060
gloves that I knit from my husband I

00:06:46.550 00:06:50.110
started them before Ravelry so they were

00:06:50.480 00:06:54.610
it was an earlier 2007 and my husband

00:06:55.010 00:06:57.070
uses liner gloves inside of mittens like

00:06:57.230 00:06:59.260
when he his skis or rides his bike or

00:06:59.570 00:07:01.480
something like that and he had a pair

00:07:01.520 00:07:05.350
that were worn out and so I said I wanna

00:07:05.480 00:07:07.030
make you another pair I'll just make him

00:07:07.370 00:07:08.650
exactly like these cuz he said they fit

00:07:08.840 00:07:11.290
really well and so his counting stitches

00:07:11.570 00:07:13.500
I'm just redoing it I knit one of them

00:07:14.510 00:07:16.270
mostly I didn't do all those fingers and

00:07:17.060 00:07:22.360
then I the color is so boring and I just

00:07:22.550 00:07:24.130
lost interest in them so I pulled him

00:07:24.290 00:07:28.780
out in 2016 and I looked at him like

00:07:29.120 00:07:31.060
this is not how I would knit a pair of

00:07:31.340 00:07:33.280
gloves if I was starting from scratch

00:07:33.910 00:07:36.460
and so then I was how would I do what I

00:07:36.590 00:07:38.950
do so I tried tried the first saw first

00:07:39.170 00:07:42.640
saw the first glove on him and I thought

00:07:42.800 00:07:45.580
the fingers were a little too short so I

00:07:46.570 00:07:50.320
redid a pattern I kind of traced his

00:07:50.690 00:07:53.410
hand and I I made some accommodations

00:07:54.170 00:07:57.580
and I knit the second glove and I think

00:07:57.710 00:08:00.700
I had maybe the thumb and half of the

00:08:01.190 00:08:04.930
pinky knit on the second glove so I

00:08:05.540 00:08:08.260
finished that tried it on him and it fit

00:08:08.630 00:08:11.470
and then I realized that the first glove

00:08:12.020 00:08:15.100
the hand was quite a bit shorter so I

00:08:15.320 00:08:15.879
had to rip

00:08:16.159 00:08:19.959
the first hand back to the base of the

00:08:20.259 00:08:22.869
thumb knit a little longer then redo the

00:08:23.120 00:08:24.399
thumb and all the fingers to the correct

00:08:24.650 00:08:27.249
length so they they fit him but they

00:08:27.439 00:08:28.779
don't fit him the way I would like them

00:08:29.000 00:08:31.689
to fit him but whatever they're done so

00:08:32.029 00:08:35.440
that was 11 years and he'll use them so

00:08:36.140 00:08:38.079
that's good so those are my three

00:08:38.599 00:08:40.870
finished things and then the sub project

00:08:41.060 00:08:44.860
that I finished was the sweater that I

00:08:45.620 00:08:49.110
started last year it's this cabled

00:08:50.120 00:08:53.680
cabled cardigan and it I knit the body

00:08:54.230 00:08:55.990
in one piece so the fronts and the backs

00:08:56.690 00:08:58.120
together and the split at the arm halls

00:09:00.100 00:09:03.220
and no if you couldn't even see what it

00:09:03.380 00:09:06.550
is it's it's it's a long cardigan so I

00:09:06.829 00:09:09.130
was a little worried about that I'd make

00:09:09.350 00:09:10.630
quite a few modifications from the

00:09:11.029 00:09:14.410
original pattern and it wasn't until I

00:09:14.540 00:09:16.720
was getting up toward the armholes that

00:09:16.760 00:09:19.509
I realized that this had a gusset and

00:09:20.029 00:09:22.329
underarm gusset and that's where the

00:09:22.610 00:09:24.939
full circumference of the chest how you

00:09:25.550 00:09:28.090
achieve that which I wasn't expecting I

00:09:28.459 00:09:30.340
looked and I saw there was no waist

00:09:30.860 00:09:33.310
shaping so and because of the way cables

00:09:33.500 00:09:36.850
are with the gauge I wasn't and it was

00:09:37.010 00:09:38.860
the whole thing I wasn't measuring it as

00:09:39.019 00:09:40.660
I went I knew I got in the correct gauge

00:09:41.149 00:09:42.850
and I had the right number of stitches

00:09:43.339 00:09:45.040
and I was knitting merrily along before

00:09:45.260 00:09:47.740
I realized the sweater was going to gain

00:09:48.079 00:09:50.620
several more inches in the chest and the

00:09:51.050 00:09:54.160
problem was my hips so when I got done

00:09:54.199 00:09:56.199
with the body I washed and blocked it

00:09:56.449 00:10:00.550
yeah yes it's going to fit and I looked

00:10:00.649 00:10:02.170
at my notes and it said I'm gonna start

00:10:02.329 00:10:05.340
the sleeves tomorrow which I didn't do

00:10:06.350 00:10:08.740
because it had been 23 days since I

00:10:09.050 00:10:10.720
started sweater and I have a three week

00:10:11.269 00:10:12.670
tolerance for projects and I don't know

00:10:12.890 00:10:14.769
why I thought I was gonna work on the

00:10:14.990 00:10:18.100
sleeves then but I didn't so I have knit

00:10:18.410 00:10:19.900
one sleeve so the sleeve hasn't been

00:10:20.899 00:10:23.829
hasn't been washed or blocked yet but I

00:10:24.319 00:10:26.410
do have one sleeve done and then I've

00:10:26.569 00:10:28.819
been taking a break from it for a couple

00:10:29.339 00:10:30.910
days while I did some other things

00:10:31.920 00:10:35.150
finish those gloves and I'll probably

00:10:35.339 00:10:38.150
get to the second sleeve this week and

00:10:38.610 00:10:39.739
that'll part of take another break so

00:10:39.839 00:10:41.569
I'm hoping to have this done at the end

00:10:41.759 00:10:42.379
of the month

00:10:43.350 00:10:44.419
hoping to wear it in the very last

00:10:44.879 00:10:50.210
finish at February video we'll see

00:10:51.220 00:10:53.250
okay so I have had questions ever since

00:10:53.350 00:10:55.590
I started cat the casual Friday videos

00:10:55.900 00:10:57.650
people have been asking me about

00:10:58.660 00:10:59.790
reference books what reference books

00:11:00.040 00:11:01.590
what I recommend so some people are

00:11:01.780 00:11:03.420
noticing it have noticed the reference

00:11:03.700 00:11:06.150
books back here and that I have

00:11:06.730 00:11:07.800
principles of knitting back here and

00:11:07.930 00:11:09.480
then I have other books and then when I

00:11:09.700 00:11:11.370
did the office tour people were asking

00:11:11.820 00:11:13.950
about reference books too so I thought

00:11:14.110 00:11:17.310
I'd talk a little bit about about

00:11:17.890 00:11:20.340
knitting reference books in general and

00:11:22.140 00:11:24.590
then general knitting reference books

00:11:25.600 00:11:27.270
specifically that makes sense so there

00:11:27.550 00:11:29.760
are a lot of different types of knitting

00:11:30.160 00:11:32.970
reference books there are books that are

00:11:33.760 00:11:35.250
meant to teach you how to knit like

00:11:36.220 00:11:37.770
because aimed at beginners and they'll

00:11:38.020 00:11:39.810
have here's how you do all of these

00:11:40.360 00:11:41.040
techniques and then they'll have

00:11:41.710 00:11:43.320
projects associated with them as you

00:11:43.750 00:11:45.540
build your skills so those are really

00:11:45.820 00:11:48.690
aimed at kind of beginner level maybe up

00:11:48.970 00:11:51.300
to early intermediate level knitters and

00:11:52.150 00:11:53.910
then you'll have reference books like

00:11:54.910 00:11:57.350
stitch dictionaries which are mostly

00:11:58.360 00:12:00.630
textured stitch patterns they typically

00:12:01.120 00:12:03.720
only include color if it's a textured

00:12:04.420 00:12:06.360
color stitch pattern like slips stitch

00:12:06.820 00:12:08.820
patterns with two or three colors or

00:12:09.220 00:12:10.370
mosaic or something like that

00:12:11.380 00:12:15.420
you don't typically see stitch

00:12:16.270 00:12:18.630
dictionaries with color work patterns in

00:12:18.820 00:12:20.610
them unless they're specific the stitch

00:12:20.860 00:12:22.440
stitch dictionary is specifically

00:12:22.900 00:12:26.880
devoted to color work so I have and I

00:12:26.920 00:12:28.920
have them in different places probably

00:12:29.290 00:12:32.160
because I mostly do textured knitting so

00:12:32.410 00:12:35.280
my textured stitch patterns like all of

00:12:35.470 00:12:38.070
the Barbara Walker Treasuries series of

00:12:38.860 00:12:40.830
stitch pattern of stitch dictionaries

00:12:41.170 00:12:45.930
and then I have a bunch of things on

00:12:46.180 00:12:48.240
faux Varian traveling twisted stitch

00:12:48.700 00:12:50.760
patterns which I really love

00:12:51.460 00:12:52.260
trying to look over here and see what

00:12:52.420 00:12:55.140
else I have knitting on the edge which

00:12:55.180 00:12:57.570
is just borders but again it's all

00:12:58.210 00:13:01.200
textured related stuff and the stitch

00:13:01.900 00:13:03.040
dictionaries that I have

00:13:03.320 00:13:05.980
on colorwork are back here and they're

00:13:06.200 00:13:09.160
all in my there kind of like a category

00:13:10.600 00:13:12.790
of faroan like I have the art of fair

00:13:12.950 00:13:14.530
isle knitting traditional fair isle

00:13:15.790 00:13:18.639
knitting charts for color knitting poems

00:13:18.860 00:13:21.759
of color I have a book on knitted Tam's

00:13:22.370 00:13:24.280
but those are you know all ferrous I

00:13:24.500 00:13:27.340
could traditional garment I use for fair

00:13:27.529 00:13:29.440
isle so the color works stuff I have

00:13:29.690 00:13:30.699
back here because they just don't use

00:13:31.160 00:13:34.480
that as much as much now I haven't ever

00:13:35.180 00:13:37.480
seen a stick stitch dictionary that was

00:13:37.940 00:13:39.340
devoted to intarsia which is the

00:13:40.240 00:13:43.449
color-block knitting maybe they exist I

00:13:44.209 00:13:48.730
have never seen that so I would be

00:13:48.950 00:13:50.110
curious about whether or not something

00:13:50.360 00:13:53.199
like that exists so so that's one type

00:13:53.269 00:13:54.759
of knitting reference book then you have

00:13:54.920 00:13:56.650
the type of reference book I'm just

00:13:56.930 00:13:58.090
looking at my books here so I can

00:13:58.339 00:14:00.790
remember what I have that are on there

00:14:01.130 00:14:03.370
related to designing network so you

00:14:03.649 00:14:04.300
might have something as that

00:14:05.060 00:14:06.699
specifically about designing sweaters or

00:14:07.610 00:14:09.310
there's like and there's a series of

00:14:09.529 00:14:13.750
books by Anne bud called the handy what

00:14:13.850 00:14:17.319
is she calls the the knitters handy book

00:14:17.630 00:14:19.780
of and then it'll be top down sweaters

00:14:20.149 00:14:22.600
or sweaters or patterns which would

00:14:22.910 00:14:24.460
include sweaters but also gloves and

00:14:24.589 00:14:29.310
mittens and socks and hats and those are

00:14:30.320 00:14:32.230
patterns but they're written in a way

00:14:32.510 00:14:34.269
that you can use any gauge and it runs

00:14:34.430 00:14:36.280
for sizes like from two years old up to

00:14:37.930 00:14:40.300
extra-large man I think either a large

00:14:40.490 00:14:42.699
or extra-large man so that runs those

00:14:43.100 00:14:45.579
that whole size thing and you the

00:14:46.459 00:14:47.920
information on the stitch count you use

00:14:48.110 00:14:50.110
this in a chart based on what gauge are

00:14:50.540 00:14:53.260
using and what size you're knitting so

00:14:53.390 00:14:55.449
it gives you basically an outline of a

00:14:55.850 00:14:58.329
of a pattern and then you can swap out

00:14:58.730 00:15:00.939
the kind of collar or whether it's a

00:15:01.790 00:15:03.790
cardigan or pullover so there's that

00:15:04.100 00:15:05.560
kind of design which is a nice way to

00:15:06.019 00:15:07.750
learn design because you have a lot of

00:15:08.500 00:15:10.449
the information kind of figured out for

00:15:10.519 00:15:11.980
you ahead of time and then you can swap

00:15:12.230 00:15:13.960
in your stitch patterns that you get

00:15:14.149 00:15:15.520
from your stitch dictionary

00:15:15.620 00:15:18.220
and then there's just things that talk

00:15:18.260 00:15:23.440
about design like figuring out things

00:15:24.070 00:15:27.250
like sleeves or necklines yourself and

00:15:28.160 00:15:28.990
measuring all that kind of stuff so

00:15:29.300 00:15:30.460
there's a lot of different design types

00:15:30.740 00:15:32.920
favorite books on pattern writing which

00:15:33.080 00:15:35.620
is not the same thing as designing you

00:15:35.810 00:15:38.050
can design something and not know how to

00:15:38.270 00:15:41.470
write a pattern and you can learn the

00:15:42.020 00:15:43.300
how to write a pattern without really

00:15:43.550 00:15:45.880
knowing how to design this completely to

00:15:46.220 00:15:48.670
two different skill sets and those two

00:15:48.980 00:15:51.340
skills that Scouts are skill sets are

00:15:51.710 00:15:53.260
different from just being a good knitter

00:15:54.490 00:15:57.310
so there's those are the kind of books I

00:15:57.530 00:15:58.600
have over there

00:15:58.700 00:16:02.590
and then then I have things that are by

00:16:02.930 00:16:06.670
cat by knitting type so sometimes it

00:16:06.860 00:16:07.930
might be a knitting tradition like the

00:16:08.480 00:16:09.550
feral that I was talking about which is

00:16:10.190 00:16:11.340
stranded colorwork

00:16:12.350 00:16:13.930
but then I've got a book on that's only

00:16:14.120 00:16:15.760
about brioche I've got another one

00:16:16.010 00:16:18.810
called shadow knitting which is that

00:16:19.820 00:16:21.010
that's the other name for that where

00:16:21.290 00:16:23.410
it's like from the side where you it's

00:16:23.570 00:16:25.720
like you it looks like a striped item

00:16:26.000 00:16:27.700
and illusion knitting that's what it's

00:16:27.950 00:16:30.460
called so the book on shadow knitting I

00:16:31.250 00:16:35.560
have one on twined knitting I have an D

00:16:35.720 00:16:39.700
and folk knitting I have Norwegian

00:16:40.070 00:16:42.100
mittens and gloves so sometimes the

00:16:42.350 00:16:44.110
books are about specific type of garment

00:16:44.870 00:16:46.560
sometimes they're a specific ethnic

00:16:47.570 00:16:48.460
tradition and sometimes it's a

00:16:48.830 00:16:53.380
combination of that I have books that

00:16:53.690 00:16:56.380
are about like this is no idle hands the

00:16:56.839 00:16:58.060
social history of knitting I've got

00:16:58.820 00:17:00.010
knitting around the world that talks

00:17:00.700 00:17:05.620
shows different traditions of knitting

00:17:05.930 00:17:07.720
it's mostly like a coffee table type of

00:17:07.970 00:17:11.590
book I've got Richard ruts history of

00:17:12.110 00:17:13.750
knitting hand knitting which is really

00:17:13.880 00:17:16.630
interesting to me I've got a lot of

00:17:16.910 00:17:18.970
stuff about Aaron knitting I keep some

00:17:19.010 00:17:21.550
of the Aaron knitting stuff here and

00:17:22.100 00:17:24.610
some of this is reference material not

00:17:24.920 00:17:27.630
because it's just a stick dictionary

00:17:27.850 00:17:29.190
but because they have historical

00:17:29.830 00:17:31.410
information sometimes that that

00:17:32.080 00:17:33.830
historical information is inaccurate

00:17:36.030 00:17:39.420
like this this book right here

00:17:39.940 00:17:43.140
this traditional Aran knitting book

00:17:43.450 00:17:46.490
talks about a lot of the mythology of

00:17:47.500 00:17:50.400
and it's but treating it as if it's

00:17:51.070 00:17:54.900
historical fact about identifying

00:17:55.600 00:17:57.210
fishermen based on the cables in their

00:17:57.700 00:17:59.400
pattern when they you know were drowned

00:17:59.620 00:18:01.020
and washed up on the shore and that's

00:18:01.570 00:18:04.370
just a myth it's a marketing scheme

00:18:05.380 00:18:07.830
because errant sweaters first of all no

00:18:08.440 00:18:09.060
fisherman would ever wear a

00:18:09.430 00:18:15.210
cream-colored sweater and secondly they

00:18:15.460 00:18:17.100
weren't identified by the cable patterns

00:18:17.470 00:18:18.990
and the fishermen were wore a different

00:18:19.330 00:18:21.030
type of garment is the whole thing but

00:18:21.370 00:18:24.660
our star Mar has a really good section

00:18:24.790 00:18:28.080
in her book on the history of Aran

00:18:28.660 00:18:30.120
knitting and how it was developed and

00:18:30.970 00:18:34.140
examples of the early the early designs

00:18:34.540 00:18:36.570
that some inventive knitters came up

00:18:36.820 00:18:40.410
with so so a lot of times these stitch

00:18:41.110 00:18:42.750
dictionaries or traditional knitting

00:18:43.480 00:18:44.940
pattern or traditional knitting style

00:18:45.280 00:18:47.610
books will have interesting historical

00:18:47.890 00:18:50.550
information and sometimes you'll you'll

00:18:50.740 00:18:52.290
see a lot of patterns in there but

00:18:52.420 00:18:54.720
you'll also have a reference section

00:18:54.850 00:18:56.100
that will explain how to design that

00:18:56.470 00:18:58.250
sort of thing yourself

00:18:59.520 00:19:03.810
so what else that's probably you know

00:19:04.030 00:19:05.340
there's tons of different kinds of

00:19:06.280 00:19:07.440
references and like I said a lot of them

00:19:07.870 00:19:09.480
bleed over into each other but then you

00:19:09.670 00:19:12.330
have the general knitting reference book

00:19:12.580 00:19:17.790
and those can vary quite a bit not even

00:19:18.130 00:19:19.830
just in their quality but in the depth

00:19:20.110 00:19:21.840
and breadth of the material on the ease

00:19:22.060 00:19:24.810
at which they can be used so when I

00:19:25.270 00:19:27.030
learned to knit I learned to knit from

00:19:27.820 00:19:29.880
the knit kit which I showed in that this

00:19:30.220 00:19:33.090
first casual Friday and it was a decent

00:19:33.520 00:19:35.640
sized reference book and so I used it to

00:19:35.950 00:19:38.220
learn to knit so I didn't understand

00:19:38.620 00:19:40.650
that there might be some use

00:19:40.720 00:19:44.420
or utility behind having a general

00:19:46.590 00:19:49.200
knitting book I just thought why I know

00:19:49.360 00:19:50.730
how to knit I can follow the directions

00:19:50.980 00:19:52.230
in the pattern why would I need a

00:19:52.660 00:19:54.810
general knitting reference book but for

00:19:54.910 00:19:56.280
the master hand aiding program when you

00:19:56.650 00:19:58.470
first get your information packet they

00:19:58.840 00:20:01.050
include a bibliography of just tons of

00:20:01.510 00:20:02.430
knitting reference books and they're

00:20:02.800 00:20:05.330
kind of by category sort of like how I

00:20:06.340 00:20:08.310
described him here and when so for every

00:20:08.620 00:20:10.260
swatch every question you answer every

00:20:10.780 00:20:12.180
report you write and anything that you

00:20:12.490 00:20:14.460
do anything you're submitting to them

00:20:14.770 00:20:16.800
has to have at least one reference cited

00:20:17.170 00:20:17.730
sometimes you have to have multiple

00:20:18.510 00:20:22.080
reference references so so then that's

00:20:22.300 00:20:23.700
the first thing a lot of people have to

00:20:23.890 00:20:25.470
do when they when they start the master

00:20:25.660 00:20:26.850
hand ating program is they have to buy

00:20:27.100 00:20:28.950
some general knitting reference books

00:20:29.380 00:20:31.550
and they're always looking for advice so

00:20:32.560 00:20:34.440
when I joined it was before Ravelry and

00:20:35.440 00:20:37.530
but the knitting guild Association did

00:20:37.960 00:20:41.250
have online forums for members and then

00:20:41.440 00:20:42.750
there was a section of the forms that

00:20:42.880 00:20:44.130
were for people who are going through

00:20:44.320 00:20:46.770
the master hand aiding program and so

00:20:47.200 00:20:48.630
everybody was asking like what which

00:20:48.910 00:20:50.430
books do you get how many do we need and

00:20:51.100 00:20:52.620
so there were a handful of books that

00:20:52.870 00:20:55.050
came up over and over and over again as

00:20:55.510 00:20:58.010
really good reference books now I have

00:20:59.020 00:21:01.470
all five of those now but I didn't get

00:21:01.660 00:21:03.210
all five the beginning one of them was

00:21:03.460 00:21:05.760
not in print principles of knitting the

00:21:06.040 00:21:08.150
first edition had been out of print for

00:21:09.160 00:21:11.040
years and there was rumors that it was

00:21:11.260 00:21:12.690
going to come a second edition was going

00:21:12.790 00:21:14.520
to come out but it kept getting pushback

00:21:14.980 00:21:17.850
so you just given up on the idea that I

00:21:17.980 00:21:19.740
would ever own a copy of it and that

00:21:19.960 00:21:21.390
whatever a new edition would ever come

00:21:21.550 00:21:27.150
out because yes sir be so used copies of

00:21:28.000 00:21:29.430
the principles of knitting at that time

00:21:29.650 00:21:30.900
right three hundred three hundred and

00:21:31.150 00:21:32.430
fifty dollars so there's no way I was

00:21:32.590 00:21:34.140
going to buy one of those so then that

00:21:34.360 00:21:37.440
left four books and one of them was

00:21:38.320 00:21:41.210
vogue knitting ultimate knitting book

00:21:42.220 00:21:43.950
which I have here and it came with a

00:21:44.740 00:21:46.560
book jacket which I don't happen it's a

00:21:47.080 00:21:50.910
fairly a big book it's like and it lays

00:21:51.340 00:21:52.920
flat so it's the kind of thing where if

00:21:53.050 00:21:54.070
you have it on your table

00:21:54.679 00:21:57.149
you can look at it and it will lay flat

00:21:58.159 00:22:01.710
it has a combination of drawings and

00:22:02.720 00:22:04.570
also photographs depending on what the

00:22:05.000 00:22:07.750
techniques are so that was one book

00:22:08.450 00:22:12.720
another book was Reader's Digest

00:22:13.730 00:22:16.180
knitters handbook by month Monta Stanley

00:22:16.399 00:22:22.930
I think it's mom see mo and TSE that was

00:22:23.269 00:22:26.470
one that people recommended then there

00:22:26.889 00:22:29.560
was the knitters book of finishing

00:22:30.200 00:22:32.740
techniques by Nancy Wiseman which is

00:22:32.990 00:22:34.299
quite a bit smaller than either the

00:22:34.490 00:22:36.970
other two but it fits in your knitting

00:22:37.309 00:22:39.820
bag so it has a spiral binding and it

00:22:39.980 00:22:42.240
will it will lay flat if you need it to

00:22:43.630 00:22:47.100
sew and then the fourth one that people

00:22:48.110 00:22:50.409
commented about was this book called big

00:22:50.840 00:22:56.560
book of knitting by Katharina bus so I

00:22:57.200 00:22:58.629
want to talk about the three that I got

00:22:58.820 00:23:00.310
right away and then I'll talk about big

00:23:00.500 00:23:04.570
book of knitting so vogue ultimate

00:23:04.850 00:23:05.860
knitting book if that one is out of

00:23:06.169 00:23:08.379
print now I believe it was replaced and

00:23:08.840 00:23:10.419
I don't know if it's still in print but

00:23:10.460 00:23:13.720
I believe it was replaced by vogue

00:23:14.679 00:23:17.409
knitting encyclopedia of knitting which

00:23:17.929 00:23:20.049
I don't know when that one came out it

00:23:20.090 00:23:21.580
came out probably eight years ago or

00:23:22.159 00:23:23.799
seven and eight years ago maybe and it's

00:23:23.960 00:23:25.930
about the same size but when I looked

00:23:26.210 00:23:27.610
through it it was quite different so

00:23:28.429 00:23:29.649
vogue knitting ultimate knitting book

00:23:30.019 00:23:32.320
may or may not still be available used

00:23:32.809 00:23:37.029
in different places and this book it

00:23:37.490 00:23:38.769
really does aim to be sort of an

00:23:39.320 00:23:41.799
all-inclusive book aimed at beginning

00:23:42.110 00:23:43.149
knitters up through people who are

00:23:43.700 00:23:45.639
designing it's got a small stitch

00:23:46.309 00:23:48.940
dictionary in there it has patterns that

00:23:49.070 00:23:51.190
are modular patterns so in the eye in

00:23:51.350 00:23:54.519
the same vein as an bud bud books but

00:23:54.740 00:23:56.320
not quite the same not in that same

00:23:56.840 00:23:59.860
style of how you plug numbers in but it

00:24:00.019 00:24:01.269
has a lot of information on different

00:24:01.610 00:24:03.760
types of necklines and pockets and

00:24:04.929 00:24:06.909
finishing details that you might want to

00:24:07.220 00:24:08.010
swap in and out of

00:24:08.620 00:24:10.500
different sweaters and then has all

00:24:10.630 00:24:12.120
these chapters on various techniques

00:24:12.400 00:24:14.310
like casting on and binding off and

00:24:14.860 00:24:17.880
increases and decreases and for some

00:24:18.400 00:24:19.890
techniques I think it's really good like

00:24:20.490 00:24:23.370
I it was it was the book that I learned

00:24:23.559 00:24:26.690
how to graft a garter stitch I think

00:24:27.700 00:24:29.400
because I couldn't find that specific

00:24:29.559 00:24:31.200
information anywhere else so it's really

00:24:31.480 00:24:34.340
good for some things that the bit about

00:24:35.350 00:24:38.730
decreases is terrible like it's it's

00:24:39.130 00:24:40.830
like if you needed to learn about

00:24:41.620 00:24:43.440
decreases I would never go to this book

00:24:44.010 00:24:46.799
um it it doesn't tell you when one

00:24:47.230 00:24:48.930
decrease is a mirror of another one it

00:24:49.630 00:24:50.940
doesn't tell it doesn't always have the

00:24:51.429 00:24:53.430
mirror for another decrease it doesn't

00:24:53.590 00:24:55.410
tell you if it's twisted or untwisted it

00:24:55.720 00:24:57.090
doesn't and I don't believe it even has

00:24:57.510 00:24:59.730
the decreases on the purl side it's just

00:25:00.340 00:25:02.240
that particular section is really weak

00:25:03.250 00:25:05.669
they don't make any attempt to use the

00:25:05.890 00:25:07.590
name the common names that are used for

00:25:08.550 00:25:11.400
decreases or increases they call them

00:25:11.770 00:25:13.410
version a version B's so there's no way

00:25:13.750 00:25:15.960
if you need to look something up because

00:25:16.090 00:25:17.040
you didn't know how to do it you

00:25:17.380 00:25:19.980
wouldn't be able to use that this book

00:25:20.350 00:25:24.600
for decreases but to some extent that's

00:25:24.820 00:25:26.730
true for a lot of knitting reference

00:25:27.040 00:25:30.299
books they don't they they'll have a

00:25:30.910 00:25:32.940
chapter on decreases and they may even

00:25:33.309 00:25:34.770
tell you what's mirrored and what's not

00:25:35.050 00:25:37.590
and what's twist and what's not but they

00:25:37.870 00:25:41.490
don't always give you the common names

00:25:41.679 00:25:44.460
for those techniques so that can be a

00:25:44.559 00:25:45.990
challenge when you're trying to look

00:25:46.270 00:25:48.990
things up in any book now the knitters

00:25:49.300 00:25:51.180
book of finishing techniques when I got

00:25:51.460 00:25:54.780
this book I was at first I was horribly

00:25:55.540 00:25:56.160
disappointed in it because I was

00:25:56.500 00:25:57.600
flipping through it I didn't read the

00:25:58.030 00:25:59.040
beginning I was just flipping through it

00:25:59.380 00:26:01.919
and I'm like how are increases and

00:26:02.080 00:26:04.140
decreases and caps on methods finishing

00:26:04.630 00:26:05.790
techniques that doesn't make any sense

00:26:06.190 00:26:08.970
and then I you know started reading the

00:26:09.490 00:26:11.370
the beginning information and I realized

00:26:11.590 00:26:14.790
oh if you want a really good finished

00:26:15.340 00:26:17.940
result you need to plan for that before

00:26:18.130 00:26:19.830
you cast on and you need to pick the

00:26:19.990 00:26:21.280
right cast on and then you have to

00:26:21.380 00:26:23.500
the right decreases and increases and

00:26:23.600 00:26:24.460
you have to place them in the correct

00:26:25.010 00:26:29.230
place so this is a really good book for

00:26:29.960 00:26:31.440
I would say beginners to intermediate

00:26:32.500 00:26:36.130
knitters because it has ninety to

00:26:36.560 00:26:38.500
ninety-five percent of any technique

00:26:38.870 00:26:40.750
that will ever be called for in a given

00:26:41.240 00:26:43.210
knitting pattern is probably in here now

00:26:43.550 00:26:46.540
it's probably not the most finessed

00:26:47.270 00:26:50.020
version of certain techniques but it

00:26:50.330 00:26:52.360
will hat it has you know long tail cast

00:26:52.550 00:26:54.460
on cable cast on it has I believe it has

00:26:54.830 00:26:56.320
knitting on it has the crochet cast on

00:26:56.450 00:26:58.450
it has provisional cast on so it has

00:26:58.970 00:27:00.970
things that are used well at least it

00:27:01.220 00:27:03.840
has one version of just about any

00:27:04.850 00:27:08.290
technique like that so you know it has a

00:27:08.600 00:27:10.480
vertical buttonhole a horizontal button

00:27:10.730 00:27:12.490
hole and I'm Garen over buttonhole but

00:27:12.590 00:27:15.430
it doesn't again finesse it to get the

00:27:15.830 00:27:17.410
best possible result just sort of the

00:27:17.600 00:27:19.600
most common result but what it does do

00:27:20.120 00:27:22.240
is it gives you the advantages and

00:27:22.930 00:27:25.630
disadvantages of any given technique and

00:27:25.820 00:27:28.210
one you might want to use it that was

00:27:28.610 00:27:30.730
something that I learned a lot from this

00:27:31.040 00:27:34.000
book about about techniques that you

00:27:34.550 00:27:37.090
don't necessarily use the same technique

00:27:37.340 00:27:38.560
every time you cast on with an edge you

00:27:39.080 00:27:41.140
don't just because you like the long

00:27:41.390 00:27:42.640
tail cast on doesn't mean you should

00:27:42.830 00:27:46.660
always use it so that was been really

00:27:46.880 00:27:48.730
helpful to me if it's in your knitting

00:27:49.100 00:27:52.600
in your knitting book bag and it's it

00:27:52.730 00:27:54.940
can be really helpful so I what I was

00:27:55.100 00:27:56.170
doing the master hand aiding program I

00:27:56.450 00:27:58.810
found this very useful up to about maybe

00:27:58.880 00:28:01.210
in the middle of level 2 and then I

00:28:01.700 00:28:02.650
didn't need it as much because I was

00:28:02.900 00:28:05.650
really looking for often for the best

00:28:05.960 00:28:07.600
way to do something but this has a lot

00:28:08.330 00:28:10.650
to teach you about why and when you use

00:28:11.660 00:28:14.170
specific techniques so that's really

00:28:15.310 00:28:19.830
good this book the knitters handbook is

00:28:20.840 00:28:23.920
it's probably the book that I still use

00:28:24.620 00:28:27.250
the most like if I can't remember how to

00:28:27.470 00:28:30.130
do something or if I'm like you know are

00:28:30.290 00:28:31.540
there isn't there another way if I just

00:28:31.730 00:28:33.570
want to look in one source I'll look in

00:28:33.760 00:28:34.950
here and then if I can't find it then

00:28:35.080 00:28:36.540
I'll start looking everywhere else and

00:28:36.790 00:28:39.270
sometimes I open all my books and then I

00:28:39.700 00:28:40.740
compare well what are they saying what

00:28:40.840 00:28:41.970
are they saying what are they saying

00:28:42.280 00:28:44.010
because they may not all have the same

00:28:44.500 00:28:46.650
techniques they may not all explain the

00:28:46.840 00:28:48.360
same techniques in the same way and they

00:28:48.520 00:28:50.040
may not agree on which is the best

00:28:50.470 00:28:53.070
technique but this this book it first of

00:28:53.140 00:28:56.220
all doesn't lie flat so I need to get

00:28:57.090 00:29:00.150
this change what I do sometimes with my

00:29:00.460 00:29:02.400
books that I want to use a lot in lay

00:29:02.740 00:29:04.080
flat like this book did not come with a

00:29:04.630 00:29:07.230
spiral I took it to Kinko's and had them

00:29:07.600 00:29:09.810
chop the binding off and put a spiral on

00:29:10.000 00:29:11.520
there that way it will lay flat or you

00:29:11.800 00:29:13.920
can flip it in half like this so that it

00:29:14.580 00:29:16.590
will be more useful so I've done that

00:29:16.870 00:29:18.570
with my stitch dictionaries I've done

00:29:18.700 00:29:20.310
that with a few other books that I've

00:29:20.560 00:29:22.740
used a lot I haven't done it to this one

00:29:22.960 00:29:25.890
and I don't know why but I really should

00:29:26.320 00:29:28.080
but what's so great about this book is

00:29:28.120 00:29:30.840
that it it has like 20 or 30 different

00:29:31.120 00:29:33.540
ways of casting on or binding off when

00:29:34.030 00:29:37.950
it explains decreases it groups them or

00:29:38.560 00:29:39.840
increases it groups them together so

00:29:39.880 00:29:41.580
that she tells you the right right

00:29:41.800 00:29:43.650
leading in the left leaning and she

00:29:43.900 00:29:45.390
tells you how to do it on the purl side

00:29:45.580 00:29:46.590
of the work as well

00:29:47.200 00:29:49.170
so like a central double decrease for

00:29:49.600 00:29:51.630
example isn't really that hard it's easy

00:29:51.910 00:29:54.060
to get the hang of and execute once you

00:29:54.940 00:29:56.370
understand what the steps are but trying

00:29:56.440 00:29:59.280
to do that from the purl side trying to

00:29:59.560 00:30:00.990
figure out how to do that from the purl

00:30:01.240 00:30:04.890
side is like ridiculous because it's

00:30:05.260 00:30:07.260
much more difficult but she has it in

00:30:07.600 00:30:11.970
here so at these if the if there are

00:30:12.340 00:30:14.340
drawings she will have one drawing

00:30:14.650 00:30:16.170
there's no photograph well there's maybe

00:30:16.450 00:30:18.360
in the middle there's a couple of color

00:30:19.000 00:30:21.650
photographs on a couple of pages well

00:30:22.660 00:30:24.030
actually I'm lying there color

00:30:24.640 00:30:26.310
photographs throughout but not of the

00:30:27.010 00:30:28.020
techniques they usually have finished

00:30:28.450 00:30:30.990
items to show examples of things this

00:30:31.330 00:30:34.710
book though is really really good but

00:30:36.420 00:30:39.350
again if you're trying to look up a

00:30:40.360 00:30:41.310
technique that you that you don't know

00:30:41.500 00:30:43.290
how to do and you have a specific name

00:30:43.360 00:30:44.850
for it that can be a little tricky

00:30:45.070 00:30:46.500
sometimes so sometimes you have to go to

00:30:46.660 00:30:47.370
that chapter yeah

00:30:47.470 00:30:49.050
to figure out where is this being used

00:30:49.300 00:30:51.300
in a garment or in a project and you

00:30:51.460 00:30:53.160
might have to think a little bit and be

00:30:53.410 00:30:54.360
creative when they're thinking when

00:30:54.490 00:30:58.020
you're using the index now the last book

00:30:58.480 00:31:02.550
this big book of knitting this is a book

00:31:03.660 00:31:05.790
that people raved about and they said

00:31:05.890 00:31:08.460
I'll use this a lot in level two for the

00:31:08.590 00:31:11.700
master who nating program I certainly

00:31:12.070 00:31:13.860
didn't use it for level one I did use it

00:31:14.050 00:31:18.270
a bit for level two I didn't really

00:31:18.970 00:31:22.050
understand how great this book was

00:31:22.330 00:31:24.720
because it has it's it's just a little

00:31:25.090 00:31:26.820
different I mean it like I'm opening up

00:31:27.040 00:31:28.650
it's got a thing about pockets here and

00:31:28.780 00:31:34.350
it's got a section on hemming and you

00:31:34.450 00:31:35.760
know all kinds of things that other

00:31:36.160 00:31:37.500
books might have but a lot of sometimes

00:31:37.810 00:31:39.620
it's just presented in a different way

00:31:40.630 00:31:43.320
and years ago when I had my knitting

00:31:43.510 00:31:45.540
column on Ravelry in this week in

00:31:46.060 00:31:48.410
Ravelry somebody asked me a question

00:31:49.420 00:31:51.420
they were they were using a pattern from

00:31:51.940 00:31:53.700
Rebecca magazine which is a German

00:31:53.890 00:31:56.250
language magazine that that now is also

00:31:56.650 00:32:00.240
available in English but but she was

00:32:00.790 00:32:02.910
knitting something that had a zipper it

00:32:03.070 00:32:04.410
was gonna have a zipper installed and

00:32:04.540 00:32:05.580
then she didn't understand the

00:32:06.100 00:32:08.490
instructions for the zipper facing and I

00:32:08.740 00:32:09.840
read through and I wasn't quite sure

00:32:10.300 00:32:12.480
either so I got out you know some yarn

00:32:12.670 00:32:14.850
and needles and I was able to figure out

00:32:15.520 00:32:16.650
what was going on I thought well that's

00:32:19.240 00:32:21.600
huh and I'd never seen anything like it

00:32:22.030 00:32:24.960
and so I looked in all of my reference

00:32:25.300 00:32:28.080
books about super facings

00:32:28.860 00:32:31.650
and some of them might explain how to

00:32:31.780 00:32:35.130
install the zipper but no none of them

00:32:35.350 00:32:37.260
had that so that for so Rebecca is a

00:32:38.080 00:32:41.010
German bank knitting mixing um and big

00:32:41.230 00:32:42.810
book of knitting is translated from

00:32:43.270 00:32:45.000
German this is an English book but it's

00:32:45.490 00:32:47.340
translated from German this was the only

00:32:47.890 00:32:50.700
book the had a zipper facing like that

00:32:50.830 00:32:53.220
is he was identical the technique was

00:32:53.440 00:32:55.250
slightly different it was sort of like

00:32:56.260 00:32:58.680
the difference between an SSK and skp

00:32:59.350 00:33:00.660
decrease where they give you the same

00:33:01.480 00:33:02.820
but they just get there in slightly

00:33:02.980 00:33:04.920
different ways so it had a slightly

00:33:05.440 00:33:06.540
different take on it so I thought well

00:33:06.700 00:33:07.860
that's really interesting so I wrote an

00:33:09.000 00:33:11.100
article in the ask another column and

00:33:11.200 00:33:12.360
then I did a little video that went

00:33:12.460 00:33:14.430
along with it and I thought well that's

00:33:15.310 00:33:16.500
then I started thinking well this is

00:33:17.470 00:33:19.530
focus is kind of more interesting and

00:33:19.810 00:33:23.070
then I got to a point where I've been

00:33:23.320 00:33:25.530
using short rows and I hadn't understood

00:33:25.960 00:33:28.080
them I think it took me four years of

00:33:28.540 00:33:30.690
using short rows in all sorts of

00:33:30.820 00:33:34.770
different patterns for things to finally

00:33:35.470 00:33:41.660
click with me like oh okay I get it

00:33:42.670 00:33:43.950
because I always just had to trust the

00:33:44.410 00:33:48.660
pattern and so it was a time when of

00:33:48.790 00:33:50.760
there were a lot of bloggers and people

00:33:51.010 00:33:52.320
I'm Ravelry talking about different

00:33:52.540 00:33:53.730
types of short row techniques besides

00:33:54.310 00:33:56.330
wrap and turn because a lot of people

00:33:57.340 00:33:58.530
really don't like him including me I

00:33:58.930 00:34:00.960
didn't like wrap and turn short rows so

00:34:01.950 00:34:04.920
I went in so there were a lot of people

00:34:05.020 00:34:06.570
were really big on the Japanese short

00:34:06.790 00:34:08.880
rows at that time and I tried in mind

00:34:09.190 00:34:10.890
and I just did not have the patience for

00:34:11.170 00:34:12.990
this way too fiddly for me with the pins

00:34:13.330 00:34:14.280
there aren't ways of doing it without

00:34:14.980 00:34:16.700
pins hanging down which I didn't know

00:34:17.710 00:34:21.240
but I was just looking for let me let me

00:34:21.430 00:34:23.520
go through all my books set in the floor

00:34:23.830 00:34:25.080
all the books open two short rows

00:34:25.570 00:34:27.390
section and I'll just read through and

00:34:28.200 00:34:29.580
see what they say

00:34:29.890 00:34:33.570
and so the books that were originally

00:34:33.730 00:34:35.280
written in English all had rap and turn

00:34:35.590 00:34:37.350
and I believe some of them may have also

00:34:37.780 00:34:42.390
had yarn over method in there then I

00:34:42.760 00:34:44.280
looked in the big book of knitting and

00:34:45.100 00:34:48.000
it had two methods of short rows now the

00:34:48.430 00:34:50.910
thing about my understanding about

00:34:51.760 00:34:53.670
German knitting instructions just based

00:34:54.900 00:34:58.440
on what German knitters have said and my

00:34:59.080 00:35:00.570
experience with translated instructions

00:35:00.790 00:35:03.000
both in this book and then like when I

00:35:03.900 00:35:06.750
have had a pattern that was only in

00:35:07.150 00:35:09.960
German I Trantino work to translate into

00:35:10.140 00:35:14.260
English that they don't necessarily have

00:35:14.540 00:35:17.530
names or labels for a specific technique

00:35:17.810 00:35:20.950
that they then abbreviate so like I just

00:35:21.290 00:35:24.220
was talking about the SS K decrease they

00:35:25.030 00:35:28.120
wouldn't they wouldn't have a decrease

00:35:28.340 00:35:31.450
with that label in fact a lot of times

00:35:31.790 00:35:33.580
the instructions are so terse they just

00:35:33.770 00:35:34.840
tell you to decrease where they they

00:35:35.060 00:35:36.670
want you'd actually work two stitches

00:35:36.860 00:35:38.860
together or bind off eight of them they

00:35:39.020 00:35:41.560
use the same word so so it's a little

00:35:41.840 00:35:43.120
different so they'll be describing

00:35:43.370 00:35:44.410
something and then you had to figure out

00:35:44.690 00:35:46.930
what Oh that they're talking about and

00:35:47.180 00:35:48.760
make one increase but they don't call it

00:35:48.800 00:35:50.620
that they just explain what they want

00:35:50.720 00:35:54.460
you to do so in this book they had two

00:35:54.950 00:35:59.530
types of short rode techniques one of

00:35:59.720 00:36:02.020
them was called shortened rose with yarn

00:36:02.420 00:36:04.300
overs so I'm like okay so that's a yarn

00:36:04.610 00:36:07.780
over short row and then the other one

00:36:07.970 00:36:10.420
was called shortened rows with stitches

00:36:10.880 00:36:13.750
passed over and I'm like what has that

00:36:14.360 00:36:16.600
different than yarn over passed over you

00:36:16.700 00:36:18.310
know I didn't quite get it and I

00:36:18.650 00:36:19.750
couldn't really understand what was

00:36:20.000 00:36:21.880
going on from the pictures it didn't

00:36:21.980 00:36:24.100
look like anything in any of the other

00:36:24.350 00:36:25.510
books so I just got out yarn and needles

00:36:25.820 00:36:28.780
and I tried it and I could it has a lot

00:36:28.820 00:36:30.850
of photographs like it's just got tons a

00:36:31.340 00:36:32.470
photograph like it's got full drawing

00:36:32.840 00:36:34.570
and then a photograph next one of both

00:36:34.940 00:36:36.790
things so whichever one helps you and

00:36:37.250 00:36:38.680
then it has a results so I had as a

00:36:38.870 00:36:42.040
result of the short row in one color and

00:36:42.170 00:36:45.400
then in two colors through the contrast

00:36:45.560 00:36:46.750
so that you can actually see what was

00:36:47.030 00:36:50.230
going on so I have well this is great

00:36:50.720 00:36:53.080
and so but I'm like well what's it

00:36:53.560 00:36:58.020
called because obviously an American or

00:36:59.030 00:37:01.330
someone who speaks English and knits in

00:37:02.000 00:37:03.400
English isn't going to call it that

00:37:03.680 00:37:05.740
they're gonna have a name for it it's so

00:37:05.780 00:37:06.700
I didn't know how to look it up

00:37:06.950 00:37:08.200
I didn't haven't had a look at I wasn't

00:37:08.300 00:37:11.350
in any of my other knitting books and so

00:37:11.510 00:37:13.540
then I would go on blog tutorials

00:37:14.450 00:37:15.700
looking where they're comparing

00:37:15.950 00:37:17.110
different Sherrow techniques couldn't

00:37:17.270 00:37:18.190
find it couldn't find and couldn't find

00:37:18.820 00:37:22.750
it and eventually I realized you know

00:37:23.750 00:37:25.780
this this sounds like what they're

00:37:26.240 00:37:27.680
talking about on when you have

00:37:27.960 00:37:29.870
German sock yarn like Reggie or Opel er

00:37:30.780 00:37:31.990
meal invite or something like that

00:37:33.000 00:37:34.130
sometimes just seeing on if you take the

00:37:34.410 00:37:35.750
yarn label off on the back of the yarn

00:37:35.970 00:37:39.680
label they'll be a pattern for a sock

00:37:40.050 00:37:43.160
the sock pattern and it'll have it'll be

00:37:43.260 00:37:46.160
a short row heel and it's like oh this

00:37:46.410 00:37:48.260
is that same short road that they're

00:37:48.630 00:37:50.120
describing in that pattern but since I

00:37:50.430 00:37:51.559
didn't knit shirt row heels cuz they

00:37:51.780 00:37:54.380
didn't fit me I never had tried it and I

00:37:54.569 00:37:56.270
thought okay so I've only seen this

00:37:57.060 00:38:00.440
short row in in patterns or books that

00:38:00.599 00:38:03.140
have been translated from German and I

00:38:03.359 00:38:04.849
could tell that the result was the same

00:38:05.190 00:38:07.400
as a Japanese short row so I thought

00:38:07.740 00:38:09.500
well I started I was gonna write a

00:38:09.990 00:38:11.720
column for askin hitter and this weekend

00:38:12.089 00:38:13.280
Ravelry so uh okay well I'll just call

00:38:13.470 00:38:15.829
it German short rows because that makes

00:38:16.140 00:38:18.920
sense and so I wrote the column and did

00:38:18.960 00:38:21.400
a little video on it this is like May I

00:38:22.410 00:38:24.349
don't even know what year it was in May

00:38:24.690 00:38:27.890
of whatever year that was and then but

00:38:27.990 00:38:29.780
the editor was a new volunteer editor

00:38:30.089 00:38:32.329
and it just took you know everything was

00:38:32.880 00:38:34.990
volunteers so took tell October before

00:38:36.000 00:38:37.640
the article came out and then that was

00:38:38.180 00:38:41.240
the last issue of this week in Ravelry

00:38:41.280 00:38:43.370
and so that was the article where I

00:38:43.859 00:38:46.819
wrote about German short rows and so

00:38:47.010 00:38:49.160
thank goodness that that article came

00:38:49.260 00:38:50.990
out because people love German short

00:38:51.150 00:38:54.430
rows but so this book is responsible for

00:38:55.440 00:38:57.380
me writing that column and doing that

00:38:57.900 00:39:00.470
original video and videos and and

00:39:01.230 00:39:03.650
everything since then and so it's it's a

00:39:03.920 00:39:06.650
really remarkable book it has different

00:39:07.020 00:39:09.760
things in it then what's in other books

00:39:10.770 00:39:13.130
so oh oh oh principal is omitting one

00:39:13.380 00:39:14.599
more because somebody asked about that

00:39:15.030 00:39:17.930
so this is like a huge huge book and

00:39:18.780 00:39:21.170
this is meant to be very comprehensive

00:39:21.780 00:39:28.160
as well I I do use this when I look

00:39:28.470 00:39:32.540
things up in every in every book or if

00:39:32.730 00:39:34.730
like the if the knitters handbook

00:39:34.890 00:39:36.500
doesn't have have it in there then I

00:39:36.780 00:39:38.660
start Lobo who does have this in here

00:39:38.790 00:39:41.630
and then I'll look in this one the

00:39:41.790 00:39:45.820
the problem with this book from me is

00:39:46.830 00:39:50.960
that she recognizes there's a lot of

00:39:51.330 00:39:53.300
ambiguity in knitting terms like you'll

00:39:53.340 00:39:55.520
have one technique that can have

00:39:55.860 00:39:57.980
multiple names and you can have one

00:39:58.530 00:40:00.200
label for technique that could be used

00:40:00.390 00:40:02.720
for multiple techniques so that gets

00:40:03.270 00:40:05.450
confusing so if you were to you know she

00:40:05.730 00:40:08.030
would do name you say here's how you do

00:40:08.070 00:40:09.620
a make 1 increase well there's you know

00:40:09.690 00:40:11.210
a couple of different ways of doing make

00:40:11.460 00:40:13.220
one increases and then sometimes people

00:40:13.260 00:40:14.780
just say make one when they want you to

00:40:14.910 00:40:16.400
do whatever increase you want to do

00:40:17.640 00:40:20.510
so that's ambiguous so rather than

00:40:20.880 00:40:22.970
picking one and saying you know that's

00:40:23.190 00:40:24.410
also known as this or that or the other

00:40:24.720 00:40:26.300
thing she just came up with her own

00:40:26.610 00:40:30.500
unique names for things that would

00:40:31.160 00:40:35.300
identify that technique in a very

00:40:35.790 00:40:38.720
specific way which makes it hard to look

00:40:38.940 00:40:41.300
up so you have to go into the chapter

00:40:41.880 00:40:43.190
and you have to read through so it's a

00:40:43.470 00:40:48.880
very different sort of reference book

00:40:50.090 00:40:53.090
then let's be fair a lot of them are

00:40:53.280 00:40:55.070
this way is that you kind of have to

00:40:55.230 00:40:57.410
know what you want to do and then look

00:40:57.780 00:40:59.780
well what do they say my options are for

00:41:00.150 00:41:06.200
doing this I would say the knitters book

00:41:06.360 00:41:08.270
of finishing techniques is probably the

00:41:08.430 00:41:10.850
one that's most likely to be useful if

00:41:11.220 00:41:12.290
you're just trying to look up a

00:41:12.780 00:41:14.900
technique and you have a name for the

00:41:15.360 00:41:18.190
technique then you're more likely to

00:41:19.200 00:41:21.140
have success so these other books are

00:41:21.300 00:41:23.120
really good if you are kind of wanting

00:41:23.160 00:41:25.220
to do your own modifications or your own

00:41:25.770 00:41:28.010
design or just wanting to understand

00:41:28.620 00:41:30.530
more by reading through them instead of

00:41:30.630 00:41:34.820
just looking one specific thing up so so

00:41:35.010 00:41:36.230
those are my thoughts on general

00:41:36.750 00:41:38.660
knitting reference books I do think

00:41:38.820 00:41:40.520
they're really important I didn't know

00:41:40.770 00:41:43.340
how important they were and what I could

00:41:43.380 00:41:46.100
learn from them until I was required to

00:41:46.650 00:41:49.790
have a general knitting reference book

00:41:49.920 00:41:52.960
or two so

00:41:53.970 00:41:55.910
so that's it for today and thanks for

00:41:55.980 00:42:05.319
watching and I'll see you next week
