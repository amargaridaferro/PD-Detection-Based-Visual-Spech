there are a number of other podcasts

00:04:58.770 00:05:01.430
that I watch that I really enjoy and I

00:05:01.920 00:05:03.770
need to do another podcast episode where

00:05:03.810 00:05:06.350
I talk about all the podcasts that I

00:05:06.720 00:05:10.130
watch and enjoy and the features of each

00:05:10.410 00:05:14.090
and why I enjoy them yeah I recently

00:05:14.610 00:05:18.020
found ba ba yah yah Wendy hello I love

00:05:18.590 00:05:20.840
you entertaining and fun and

00:05:21.960 00:05:23.810
and real and you feel like you're

00:05:24.060 00:05:26.150
sitting in her living room and I love

00:05:26.430 00:05:28.130
that and that's very much what I try to

00:05:28.530 00:05:30.590
convey here is that you and I are

00:05:30.870 00:05:33.680
sitting down for a cup of joy and a chat

00:05:34.110 00:05:37.550
and I that's what I really appreciate I

00:05:38.430 00:05:41.390
don't have a knit community I don't have

00:05:41.430 00:05:44.240
a knit night that I go to you're mine at

00:05:44.460 00:05:46.510
night you're my time away you're my

00:05:47.520 00:05:50.090
conversation and those feedbacks and

00:05:50.310 00:05:52.310
those notes that I get from you all week

00:05:52.560 00:05:56.270
long are so fulfilling that's that's my

00:05:56.730 00:05:59.300
my stitching that's my community

00:05:59.520 00:06:01.970
and I just want to build that and I

00:06:02.670 00:06:05.390
enjoy it so much and I am finding ways

00:06:05.850 00:06:07.610
to incorporate you guys so that you get

00:06:07.890 00:06:09.140
more of the experience that I'm getting

00:06:09.750 00:06:11.870
we'll get back to that in the meantime

00:06:12.450 00:06:15.410
but like I said let's have a break one

00:06:15.450 00:06:17.210
of the things that I love that I've seen

00:06:17.430 00:06:19.220
on a couple of other podcasts that I

00:06:19.710 00:06:23.870
really enjoy was from time to time your

00:06:24.180 00:06:26.660
host or hostess will do a parade of

00:06:27.410 00:06:29.390
whips well they'll show everything that

00:06:29.640 00:06:31.370
they have in progress everything that is

00:06:32.150 00:06:35.480
on needles or in stages of design or

00:06:36.420 00:06:40.600
stages of whatever set of progress and I

00:06:41.610 00:06:44.570
think that's it's very fascinating for

00:06:44.610 00:06:48.080
me it gives me a view into the mind of

00:06:48.210 00:06:50.540
them they're more designers a case

00:06:51.449 00:06:54.710
and how they think it supports me in my

00:06:54.960 00:06:58.370
old shiny because we are all distracted

00:06:59.009 00:07:01.550
we are all tempted we we all see new

00:07:01.919 00:07:04.159
fibers and new patterns and we run down

00:07:04.319 00:07:05.719
that rabbit hole and everything else

00:07:05.880 00:07:08.540
just gets left and it's curious to see

00:07:08.970 00:07:10.520
what gets left behind and the reasons

00:07:10.680 00:07:17.089
behind its delays and I just where I'm

00:07:17.400 00:07:19.129
just getting back into knitting again

00:07:19.770 00:07:21.559
really unfine Lee coming up to full

00:07:21.720 00:07:23.629
speed finally coming up to full speed I

00:07:23.849 00:07:25.279
have one more physical therapy

00:07:25.729 00:07:30.559
appointment it is Thursday and although

00:07:30.960 00:07:33.920
I have a dull ache from time to time I

00:07:34.530 00:07:35.960
put in some serious knitting time

00:07:36.300 00:07:39.649
yesterday and I have full range of

00:07:41.130 00:07:43.670
despite the limp and I'm not hurting I'm

00:07:43.860 00:07:45.980
not hurting dull ache maybe but I also

00:07:46.380 00:07:48.230
slept on it which I'm not supposed to do

00:07:49.880 00:07:52.550
and good enough I'm really excited I

00:07:52.770 00:07:55.879
really feel like I'm at 90% I'm gonna

00:07:56.070 00:07:58.640
call it 90% so by Thursday of this week

00:07:59.490 00:08:01.040
I'm hoping that my physical therapist

00:08:01.199 00:08:04.490
will sign off on me as well and in worst

00:08:04.740 00:08:06.409
case scenario I may have one more week

00:08:06.659 00:08:07.879
but I'm gonna keep doing my exercises

00:08:08.310 00:08:10.550
either way and that's very important

00:08:11.009 00:08:13.249
make sure you're doing your stretches

00:08:14.190 00:08:17.060
before you knit make sure you stop in

00:08:17.430 00:08:19.790
the middle of that marathon not only to

00:08:19.979 00:08:21.709
use the restroom but did you do some

00:08:22.199 00:08:23.659
stretches as well and you can stretch on

00:08:23.699 00:08:26.020
your way to the bathroom if you've never

00:08:27.030 00:08:32.510
do all your stretches so I just I find

00:08:32.820 00:08:35.420
this parade of whips so interesting I

00:08:35.669 00:08:37.490
thought hey I'm just getting back into

00:08:38.490 00:08:40.519
I have already gone down the rabbit hole

00:08:40.649 00:08:42.500
of temptation and started a new project

00:08:42.779 00:08:44.600
that I probably shouldn't have and I

00:08:44.760 00:08:46.400
have all these things that I haven't

00:08:46.680 00:08:51.290
touched for months or longer and I want

00:08:51.390 00:08:53.990
to refocus I want to focus on these

00:08:54.209 00:08:55.579
things I want to get them moving I want

00:08:55.649 00:08:58.819
to get them done I have had calls out

00:08:59.100 00:09:01.160
from you guys saying when is this design

00:09:01.290 00:09:03.230
I'm gonna get done

00:09:04.240 00:09:05.220
that's that's in the parade and

00:09:06.160 00:09:08.370
therefore needs to be addressed and I

00:09:08.740 00:09:11.220
feel like if I do this parade and I

00:09:11.500 00:09:13.350
share this with you not only may it be

00:09:14.050 00:09:16.290
interesting to you to see my madness but

00:09:16.630 00:09:20.700
it will also put me on task and make me

00:09:21.130 00:09:23.270
focus and make me get these things done

00:09:24.280 00:09:29.430
maybe maybe temptation happens projects

00:09:29.650 00:09:31.590
come up sometimes there are deadlines

00:09:32.020 00:09:32.760
sometimes there are things that we have

00:09:33.040 00:09:35.930
to do regardless of what we want to do

00:09:36.940 00:09:40.050
life happens but let the parade begin

00:09:40.600 00:09:44.040
let's approve it I'm going to start off

00:09:44.680 00:09:46.530
like any good parade with the pretty

00:09:46.810 00:09:48.960
girls out in the front these are the

00:09:49.210 00:09:50.490
things that have my most active

00:09:51.070 00:09:53.010
attention at the moment and they're

00:09:53.260 00:09:55.980
getting the most love and we're going to

00:09:56.260 00:09:58.260
start with the the temptation that

00:09:58.690 00:10:01.230
kicked in yesterday I had a lovely chat

00:10:01.630 00:10:04.980
a video chat via Skype with my dear

00:10:05.020 00:10:08.070
friend Beck's yesterday and she had

00:10:08.620 00:10:10.950
recently purchased a sock Blanc from me

00:10:11.790 00:10:16.830
and it had a pop mate which I fell in

00:10:16.870 00:10:19.320
love with and I opted to keep for myself

00:10:20.080 00:10:26.250
and this is it this particular sock

00:10:26.620 00:10:29.220
Blanc is called royal blunders not

00:10:29.680 00:10:31.100
because I made a mistake but because

00:10:32.110 00:10:34.200
it's a beautiful royal royal purple and

00:10:35.080 00:10:38.850
it has a teal in it and I I just I love

00:10:38.950 00:10:40.680
it and I thought it was very regal in

00:10:40.840 00:10:42.630
its colours and I couldn't come up with

00:10:42.970 00:10:46.380
any other me I really racked my head on

00:10:46.450 00:10:48.210
that one and I don't know why I'm sure

00:10:48.790 00:10:50.880
you're looking at it screaming 12 other

00:10:51.190 00:10:55.650
names like boysenberry pie or her as

00:10:55.990 00:10:58.710
Beck's suggested nebula for some reason

00:10:59.110 00:11:00.960
nebula kept coming up in my head too and

00:11:01.120 00:11:03.660
it just wasn't blue navy enough for me

00:11:03.970 00:11:06.060
and the white was just a little bit too

00:11:06.900 00:11:10.620
predominant anyhoo I cast on a pair of

00:11:10.810 00:11:13.440
socks while we were chatting totally

00:11:14.340 00:11:15.990
improvised just to see

00:11:16.120 00:11:20.480
how this blank is knitting up and I'm

00:11:21.490 00:11:24.270
loving it it is so much fun it is so

00:11:25.030 00:11:26.930
pretty I think the colors are just

00:11:27.940 00:11:30.990
gorgeous I love how the sock blank

00:11:31.360 00:11:35.640
allows them to blend around and mix and

00:11:36.250 00:11:39.000
not really have any true defined pattern

00:11:39.250 00:11:41.040
it's kind of like white noise on the TV

00:11:41.290 00:11:42.660
when the channel would go off after

00:11:43.450 00:11:45.360
after a night and if you're under the

00:11:45.400 00:11:48.690
age of probably 30 you have no idea what

00:11:48.790 00:11:49.260
I'm talking about

00:11:49.930 00:11:52.110
but it's ready TV stations used to shut

00:11:52.360 00:11:53.580
down at the end of the night and you'd

00:11:53.800 00:11:56.580
get just static this is like colorful

00:11:57.220 00:12:00.450
static and I I'm forever amazed watching

00:12:01.320 00:12:04.560
it unfurl and go from this lovely

00:12:05.170 00:12:08.340
painted thing to this very pretty noisy

00:12:09.310 00:12:10.710
fun pattern

00:12:11.410 00:12:16.560
it's an improvised pattern to most to

00:12:16.690 00:12:20.490
the outside I am playing with a stitch

00:12:21.280 00:12:23.400
you totally cannot see the stitch in

00:12:23.650 00:12:27.060
this yarn is more to keep it fun and

00:12:27.490 00:12:30.900
active than a regular vanilla sock it is

00:12:31.180 00:12:34.440
an eyelet stitch that's angle I'm not

00:12:34.660 00:12:37.050
even gonna begin to try to show you but

00:12:37.360 00:12:39.990
I'm playing with it primarily because

00:12:40.330 00:12:42.270
I'm testing stitches for our design

00:12:42.990 00:12:45.480
along no I have not decided what my

00:12:46.000 00:12:48.390
design project is going to be I'm really

00:12:48.760 00:12:50.400
just toying around at this point I

00:12:50.589 00:12:51.780
haven't decided if it's going to be a

00:12:52.060 00:12:53.340
sock or a hat but that's where I'm

00:12:53.680 00:12:55.530
leaning toward I'm actually leaning a

00:12:55.570 00:12:58.530
little bit stronger toward a hat but in

00:12:58.660 00:13:00.150
the meantime instead of just knitting a

00:13:00.520 00:13:02.250
regular vanilla sock I'm toying with

00:13:02.620 00:13:04.530
this stitch as I go and I'm having great

00:13:04.930 00:13:09.600
fun with it it's it's keeping me active

00:13:09.700 00:13:11.840
and awake instead of nodding off while

00:13:12.850 00:13:14.610
knitting in the round and it's gone

00:13:14.800 00:13:15.090
really fast

00:13:15.190 00:13:18.620
I knit all of this yesterday which

00:13:19.630 00:13:21.750
doesn't look like a lot maybe to some of

00:13:21.880 00:13:24.900
you but for somebody who hasn't MIT this

00:13:25.120 00:13:26.220
is a lot and I'm really

00:13:27.220 00:13:28.890
so that's a pretty girl at the front of

00:13:29.050 00:13:31.550
the parade and she's waving and smiling

00:13:32.560 00:13:34.350
following her up there's gonna be a lot

00:13:34.390 00:13:36.030
of reaching here guys I'm sorry there's

00:13:36.280 00:13:40.190
a lot of projects here following her up

00:13:41.200 00:13:44.790
is my skwerkel socks this pattern is by

00:13:45.400 00:13:47.610
general hog buffer this is a pattern I

00:13:47.650 00:13:49.680
have been working through my physical

00:13:50.170 00:13:52.440
therapy and I used in order to help

00:13:52.780 00:13:56.850
teach myself a new technique part of my

00:13:57.130 00:13:58.890
problem I had a torn rotator cuff and I

00:13:59.050 00:14:00.720
had impingement syndrome in my right

00:14:01.170 00:14:04.260
shoulder that made knitting very painful

00:14:04.570 00:14:09.980
it made he made life painful and I as a

00:14:10.990 00:14:12.930
right-handed English knitter I put a lot

00:14:13.120 00:14:15.000
of energy into my right shoulder my

00:14:15.220 00:14:16.470
right arm while I'm knitting because I

00:14:17.460 00:14:20.400
throw to combat that and to keep me

00:14:20.770 00:14:22.770
knitting so I didn't fall into a dark

00:14:23.440 00:14:24.900
depression I taught myself the

00:14:25.750 00:14:27.500
Portuguese knitting method which is

00:14:28.510 00:14:30.510
tensioned either through a pin or by

00:14:30.790 00:14:32.250
putting the yarn around your neck which

00:14:32.410 00:14:36.330
I've actually been doing more lately the

00:14:36.790 00:14:38.970
particular technique really makes

00:14:39.750 00:14:41.850
purling incredibly easy because the yarn

00:14:42.100 00:14:43.590
is already coming from the front and

00:14:44.200 00:14:46.220
you're flicking it with your left thumb

00:14:47.230 00:14:49.560
really wonderful to embed the technique

00:14:49.780 00:14:52.650
I decided to do a whole project in the

00:14:53.230 00:14:55.320
Portuguese knitting and I decided to do

00:14:55.600 00:14:57.000
the skwerkel socks which i think is a

00:14:57.400 00:15:00.320
fun beautiful pattern and I'll show you

00:15:01.330 00:15:03.930
but I also opted to rework the pattern

00:15:04.510 00:15:07.020
because it's primarily a vanilla sock it

00:15:07.150 00:15:09.420
is just talking at but I reworked the

00:15:09.850 00:15:13.290
entire pattern to do it inside out so

00:15:14.200 00:15:15.800
that I could make use of the purling and

00:15:16.810 00:15:19.320
here is the second sock and you're

00:15:19.630 00:15:21.360
seeing the purl side which I have

00:15:22.740 00:15:24.960
valiantly been doing in the Portuguese

00:15:25.330 00:15:27.480
knitting style and it's got this really

00:15:27.820 00:15:29.430
great feature where it has a very narrow

00:15:29.860 00:15:33.630
very long heel flap very narrow it's

00:15:33.790 00:15:36.690
like six stitches and because of that it

00:15:37.090 00:15:40.060
does a double decrease for a law

00:15:40.279 00:15:42.129
way before it gets to the regular gusset

00:15:42.259 00:15:43.810
and does a regular gusset before it goes

00:15:44.029 00:15:45.999
to the foot and it makes this really

00:15:46.190 00:15:47.680
neat I'm sure you can see here this and

00:15:48.620 00:15:50.860
doing it totally backwards 90-degree

00:15:51.649 00:15:53.560
angle so that your self-striping socks

00:15:53.839 00:15:55.569
have this really neat striping feature

00:15:55.880 00:15:57.550
in it as you can see with this

00:15:57.829 00:16:00.400
particular sock I am down onto the foot

00:16:00.790 00:16:03.970
I really only have a couple more inches

00:16:04.279 00:16:07.449
of foot before I can start my toe and

00:16:08.269 00:16:12.189
this pair will be done here is the first

00:16:12.769 00:16:15.490
sock and I showed you this really pretty

00:16:15.709 00:16:19.509
good last episode where I put it on a

00:16:19.850 00:16:20.889
sock blocker which I don't have

00:16:21.620 00:16:23.410
available to me right now to show you

00:16:23.750 00:16:25.600
the back side let's see if I can turn

00:16:25.880 00:16:29.230
this to show you how that heel does this

00:16:29.959 00:16:34.749
really cool angling of the colors.i I'm

00:16:35.089 00:16:36.340
just tickled with it I think it's a neat

00:16:36.560 00:16:41.139
look and honestly it's one of the best

00:16:41.750 00:16:44.680
fitting socks I've ever knit if it's my

00:16:44.959 00:16:48.360
foot really really well I have a high

00:16:49.370 00:16:51.519
instep that's this measurement here

00:16:52.399 00:16:54.069
across from the heel to the top of your

00:16:54.290 00:16:58.389
foot and having that extra long heel

00:16:58.760 00:17:02.230
flap even narrow really made a

00:17:02.389 00:17:03.910
difference it really made a difference

00:17:04.490 00:17:06.399
and it's not I'm not getting all the

00:17:07.030 00:17:09.220
extra clumping here when I put it on my

00:17:10.490 00:17:13.840
then I often get when I try to adapt a

00:17:14.480 00:17:17.230
sock for my high instep if you've got a

00:17:17.390 00:17:19.240
high instep if you've got a thick foot

00:17:19.579 00:17:22.809
through this area here give it a try

00:17:23.120 00:17:27.370
it's a free pattern skwerkel on Ravelry

00:17:28.100 00:17:31.120
by general hog buffer I love that name I

00:17:31.280 00:17:34.390
have no idea what it refers to but the

00:17:34.580 00:17:36.850
other patterns all have this neat

00:17:37.640 00:17:40.390
geometric he he or she I'm sorry does a

00:17:40.820 00:17:42.970
variety of designs that make use of some

00:17:43.760 00:17:45.010
interesting math and there's a couple

00:17:45.320 00:17:46.680
others there that I'm gonna have to try

00:17:47.690 00:17:49.730
when I don't know I don't have time for

00:17:49.830 00:17:53.960
the things I want to do anyway that that

00:17:54.210 00:17:55.460
is the beginning of the parade that is

00:17:56.279 00:17:58.909
the front of the line then you have the

00:17:59.460 00:18:01.840
marching band and the marching band are

00:18:02.850 00:18:08.210
those projects that they have their duty

00:18:08.370 00:18:10.399
and they're marching forward nicely and

00:18:10.740 00:18:11.870
they're doing what they're supposed to

00:18:12.090 00:18:18.080
be doing resumee in a line chugging

00:18:18.179 00:18:22.269
along plan their song of those I have a

00:18:23.279 00:18:25.480
pair of acrylic socks that I'm knitting

00:18:26.490 00:18:29.779
this is part of me bringing in more

00:18:30.510 00:18:32.360
attention to the commercial yarns that

00:18:32.490 00:18:34.639
are available and the acrylics that

00:18:35.130 00:18:37.220
people are using and giving myself some

00:18:37.350 00:18:39.980
extra exposure to them and being able to

00:18:40.200 00:18:41.600
give you some information about how

00:18:42.029 00:18:44.539
these hold up against some of the indeed

00:18:45.210 00:18:45.919
irons against some of the other

00:18:46.649 00:18:49.159
commercially produced wool yarns and you

00:18:49.289 00:18:50.649
know pound for pound dollar for dollar

00:18:51.659 00:18:53.659
what my impression is of these products

00:18:53.880 00:18:58.010
I got online to joann.com and I ordered

00:18:58.289 00:19:01.180
from premier yarns a wool free sock yarn

00:19:02.190 00:19:04.220
this is the dime they're in little 50

00:19:04.500 00:19:07.779
grand balls the colors are quite pretty

00:19:08.789 00:19:11.149
at least they are on the ball and the

00:19:11.640 00:19:13.250
picture of how they should dit up is

00:19:13.500 00:19:15.440
actually really really pretty it's very

00:19:15.840 00:19:17.600
I don't know if you can see there's kind

00:19:17.760 00:19:20.870
of a glare there's a little sock there

00:19:21.000 00:19:24.529
with stripes on and the picture online

00:19:24.750 00:19:26.720
was very pretty now I'm gonna start by

00:19:27.620 00:19:30.610
saying if you order from Joanne com

00:19:31.620 00:19:36.740
joann.com is not not Amazon you will not

00:19:37.380 00:19:39.230
have instant gratification you will not

00:19:39.809 00:19:42.409
see your yarn quickly if you order

00:19:42.750 00:19:46.700
online for in-store pickup fabulous the

00:19:47.399 00:19:49.159
majority of the yarns that I found there

00:19:49.620 00:19:52.399
did not have that available to them this

00:19:52.590 00:19:55.299
was not available for in-store pickup

00:19:56.309 00:19:58.789
two weeks it took to get my product now

00:19:59.370 00:20:00.590
I understand

00:20:00.750 00:20:03.170
if I order online

00:20:04.180 00:20:05.370
legally they have four to six weeks to

00:20:05.620 00:20:09.720
deliver I and I'm spoiled rotten rotten

00:20:10.210 00:20:11.690
and I have no problem admitting that

00:20:12.700 00:20:15.840
two-day delivery is where my head is at

00:20:16.450 00:20:18.510
and when it got to be a week old I

00:20:18.850 00:20:20.280
checked my order and a hidden process

00:20:20.500 00:20:22.020
yet and when it got to be a week and a

00:20:22.060 00:20:25.230
half order in it had processed and they

00:20:25.300 00:20:26.880
were supposed to ship the next day and

00:20:27.340 00:20:28.830
then they shipped and it really only

00:20:29.080 00:20:31.650
took two days for it to travel to me but

00:20:32.380 00:20:35.160
their process is slow so their prices

00:20:35.290 00:20:35.850
are great

00:20:36.730 00:20:38.250
absolutely Joanne is a good name I

00:20:38.530 00:20:41.010
believe in them I suspect their customer

00:20:41.170 00:20:42.720
service is probably quite good I haven't

00:20:42.970 00:20:46.350
had to use it but online ordering is

00:20:46.780 00:20:49.230
slow so be patient if you order online

00:20:49.450 00:20:52.500
from them regardless I have cast on a

00:20:53.140 00:20:59.160
toe up vanilla sock using this yarn and

00:20:59.260 00:21:02.220
I'm trying to it's buried in my I don't

00:21:02.290 00:21:04.740
know how I guess oh because my physical

00:21:05.140 00:21:08.940
therapy tubing is on top of it so I have

00:21:09.190 00:21:12.120
cast on a toe up sock I'm not really

00:21:12.850 00:21:14.520
thrilled with how the stripes are

00:21:17.580 00:21:21.540
forming it's not bad I I'm not sure it

00:21:21.910 00:21:24.600
doesn't match the picture well so

00:21:25.090 00:21:27.750
sometimes I had a preconceived idea of

00:21:27.940 00:21:29.850
what it was gonna look like and it looks

00:21:30.370 00:21:32.990
different from that so I'm a little mad

00:21:34.000 00:21:35.610
the colors are definitely my colors

00:21:35.980 00:21:38.100
there are Tana mole there's kind of a

00:21:38.800 00:21:40.140
purple there's a little bit of a navy

00:21:40.510 00:21:42.560
there's a brown a beige and orange a

00:21:43.770 00:21:47.040
chartreuse it is ultimately pretty it's

00:21:47.490 00:21:51.360
pretty the hand on this is squishy and

00:21:52.210 00:21:55.950
lovely it is a tight spun acrylic and

00:21:56.380 00:21:59.070
let's see ninety-three percent acrylic

00:21:59.590 00:22:07.740
seven percent p bt proprietary blended

00:22:08.290 00:22:10.170
something or other in a tensile or

00:22:10.540 00:22:14.550
something no idea no idea what PBT is of

00:22:14.890 00:22:16.779
course machine wash and dry

00:22:17.789 00:22:21.440
235 yards over 50 grams it's it's a

00:22:21.779 00:22:23.480
synthetic absolutely and you can feel

00:22:23.639 00:22:26.210
this a synthetic but it's not a squeaky

00:22:26.879 00:22:30.139
synthetic it is not a sticky synthetic

00:22:30.659 00:22:33.139
it's very smooth it's more in line with

00:22:33.659 00:22:37.960
what you think of with a brushed rayon

00:22:38.970 00:22:41.060
it is tightly spun I'm not having

00:22:41.700 00:22:48.399
splitting issues it's there's probably

00:22:51.230 00:22:54.799
16 threads that are combed and twisted

00:22:54.990 00:22:57.350
in that I'm trying to look at it over my

00:22:57.809 00:23:02.899
finger with my glasses and my age is

00:23:03.590 00:23:05.749
showing there's probably 16 threads

00:23:06.330 00:23:09.159
twisted and that it's it's multiply

00:23:10.169 00:23:11.509
multiply let's see if I can untwist a

00:23:11.730 00:23:15.710
little bit of it no it's probably closer

00:23:15.929 00:23:21.139
to eight but because they're twisted so

00:23:21.419 00:23:23.149
tightly and because it's combed and its

00:23:23.639 00:23:25.609
host move it is actually very soft and

00:23:26.190 00:23:29.869
I have not hit any discomfort or

00:23:30.360 00:23:32.330
distaste about working with these I'm a

00:23:33.029 00:23:34.220
little bit concerned about the

00:23:34.759 00:23:38.149
breathability that that's me and my big

00:23:38.429 00:23:42.259
sweaty feet that's me but we'll find out

00:23:42.659 00:23:45.230
we will find out I am knitting toe up on

00:23:46.249 00:23:50.180
purpose so that I can go as far up my

00:23:50.399 00:23:52.700
leg as possible using my 50 gram skein

00:23:53.220 00:23:55.039
these are going to ultimately be at

00:23:55.499 00:23:58.659
least mid calf these are going to be

00:23:59.669 00:24:00.649
depending on how breathable they are

00:24:00.899 00:24:03.139
these may be deep winters or these may

00:24:03.210 00:24:08.210
be chilly Springs I I'm excited about it

00:24:08.340 00:24:10.669
and I'm enjoying the project what I'm

00:24:10.919 00:24:12.320
not excited about is I haven't done the

00:24:12.480 00:24:13.580
top and so long I'm not really sure

00:24:13.799 00:24:15.919
where to start my gusset and I do do a

00:24:16.649 00:24:19.310
reverse French heel on this so it is the

00:24:19.529 00:24:22.070
heel flap I build a gusset I turn a heel

00:24:22.320 00:24:25.900
and then I build the flap

00:24:26.570 00:24:27.880
which I really enjoy and fits my foot

00:24:28.070 00:24:30.370
well I just need to sit down do some

00:24:30.650 00:24:32.050
math so listen this one's a little bit

00:24:32.360 00:24:33.880
stalled like I need I need to sit down

00:24:33.980 00:24:35.950
and do the math but I'm really enjoying

00:24:36.380 00:24:39.640
it and I do recommend this yarn again

00:24:40.190 00:24:44.170
this was premier yarns wool free sock

00:24:45.130 00:24:48.070
and I do not remember how much I paid

00:24:48.110 00:24:49.990
for it if I had to guess I would say it

00:24:50.060 00:24:57.190
was about 399 of 50 so eight dollars per

00:24:57.410 00:24:59.610
pair of socks and some fun bright colors

00:25:00.620 00:25:02.170
the self striping is again I self

00:25:02.300 00:25:04.840
striping like this would be so cool on

00:25:05.120 00:25:07.330
the skwerkel socks so if you happen to

00:25:07.550 00:25:09.070
grab some of these and you're thinking

00:25:09.440 00:25:11.260
yeah vanilla sock but I wish I've had

00:25:11.480 00:25:12.010
something extra

00:25:12.350 00:25:15.750
try the sparkles just just too much fun

00:25:17.440 00:25:20.560
so marching band that that is the my

00:25:21.260 00:25:22.510
unnamed acrylic uh socks I need to

00:25:22.760 00:25:25.030
create a project page for that then I

00:25:27.130 00:25:31.180
have like my giant project bag my

00:25:31.700 00:25:34.450
Venetian dreams sweater which had been a

00:25:34.760 00:25:39.510
hard hard camper during my rehab however

00:25:40.520 00:25:42.460
she's marching along very nicely I'm

00:25:42.740 00:25:46.260
very excited I have a progress marker

00:25:47.270 00:25:50.410
I'm digging for it I'm sorry yeah haha

00:25:51.200 00:25:53.200
further down that I thought that's my

00:25:54.020 00:26:03.160
progress keeper right there and I did

00:26:03.410 00:26:06.220
all this in the round here and then this

00:26:06.530 00:26:09.580
is the front bottom lace section is knit

00:26:09.740 00:26:10.960
from the top down that's why I'm holding

00:26:11.210 00:26:13.330
things upside down and I have one more

00:26:14.180 00:26:16.570
repeat of the lace before I do the

00:26:17.030 00:26:19.780
Garter and bind off and then I do the

00:26:20.120 00:26:22.710
back separated section I have

00:26:23.720 00:26:28.060
collectively knit on this I did two

00:26:28.430 00:26:30.340
inches in the round and then I have done

00:26:30.650 00:26:33.640
better part of six inches on the front

00:26:34.090 00:26:36.159
half yes

00:26:36.730 00:26:39.970
I will wear this sweater someday it's

00:26:40.460 00:26:42.549
actually moving along really really fast

00:26:42.590 00:26:47.049
I have 6/10 I have 17 rows left on the

00:26:47.299 00:26:48.729
front before I bind off and then I do

00:26:48.950 00:26:51.519
the back and then it sleeves and the

00:26:51.559 00:26:54.849
neckline and I'm done I did have a

00:26:55.100 00:26:56.889
little bit of a panic last night I was

00:26:57.289 00:26:58.840
working on it I only did like three rows

00:26:59.210 00:27:03.909
last night where I had knit the body

00:27:04.369 00:27:06.460
from the top down alternating between

00:27:07.129 00:27:09.849
two skeins this if if you're following

00:27:09.889 00:27:12.249
along my project page for this is the

00:27:12.830 00:27:14.200
memoir sweater and this is the yarn that

00:27:14.359 00:27:16.119
I bought when I was in Maine visiting my

00:27:18.609 00:27:22.359
mother this is like I said the Venetian

00:27:23.049 00:27:26.440
dream pattern and this is by Josie

00:27:27.200 00:27:29.529
I love her patterns they're well written

00:27:30.139 00:27:31.840
they fit me nicely without a lot of

00:27:32.330 00:27:33.669
alterations the only alteration I have

00:27:33.799 00:27:38.680
to make his arm hole depth but this

00:27:39.169 00:27:41.019
stalled really hard this really hung

00:27:41.239 00:27:43.060
back for a long time I just couldn't

00:27:43.220 00:27:44.619
knit on it and my gauge was all wonky

00:27:45.080 00:27:47.470
doing the Portuguese knitting and now

00:27:47.690 00:27:49.899
that I can knit the way I normally knit

00:27:50.149 00:27:52.210
and my gauge is matching out I'm making

00:27:52.340 00:27:55.629
good progress on it but last night I did

00:27:55.789 00:27:58.060
I gave myself a scare I had been working

00:27:58.340 00:28:00.669
it alternately because it is a hand dyed

00:28:01.600 00:28:04.090
yarn that's a variegated back and forth

00:28:04.249 00:28:05.710
between two skeins as I work down

00:28:05.749 00:28:08.379
through the body when I got to the

00:28:08.960 00:28:09.970
divide for the front and the back

00:28:10.460 00:28:13.229
because it has a split hemline I worked

00:28:14.239 00:28:16.840
too for a wild down the front flap in

00:28:16.879 00:28:18.159
the stockinette section and then when I

00:28:18.289 00:28:20.109
get to the lace I reverted to using just

00:28:20.539 00:28:24.249
one and it's not pulling it's not I'm

00:28:24.320 00:28:25.779
not seeing a problem with it looks nice

00:28:26.119 00:28:27.039
I'm happy with it

00:28:27.259 00:28:31.119
and I don't feel like I think the lace

00:28:31.399 00:28:34.269
and the yarn are balancing nicely it's a

00:28:34.549 00:28:36.399
very subtle lace that really adds more

00:28:37.009 00:28:40.359
visual texture and it's not totally

00:28:40.580 00:28:43.359
being drowned out too by the pattern of

00:28:43.460 00:28:46.269
the yarn but it's not fully visible

00:28:46.700 00:28:47.640
either it's

00:28:47.740 00:28:50.430
nice balance I think I'm happy with it I

00:28:51.100 00:28:52.410
didn't lose it entirely you can tell

00:28:52.600 00:28:55.650
that there's lace there however like I

00:28:55.900 00:28:58.140
said I was working along with just one

00:28:58.300 00:29:03.480
of the skeins and it ran out and so I

00:29:03.730 00:29:05.820
picked up the other bit that I had been

00:29:06.070 00:29:08.340
using for the body and I'm using that

00:29:08.620 00:29:11.340
and they'll be enough to finish the

00:29:11.620 00:29:13.320
front flap I don't know that they'll be

00:29:13.840 00:29:16.140
enough to finish the back flap before I

00:29:16.270 00:29:17.960
need to start a fresh skein of yarn I

00:29:18.970 00:29:22.230
bought four skeins of this yarn I always

00:29:22.600 00:29:25.160
have it in my head and I think this is a

00:29:26.170 00:29:28.530
conservative habit of mine to believe

00:29:28.840 00:29:30.180
that half of the yarn needs to be

00:29:30.640 00:29:32.520
reserved for sleeves and finishing for

00:29:33.010 00:29:37.010
collars and such and I think that's

00:29:38.020 00:29:39.180
aggressive I think that's it's a

00:29:39.580 00:29:41.070
conservative statement to be sure that I

00:29:41.170 00:29:45.600
have enough so the idea that I am going

00:29:45.700 00:29:47.490
to be more than halfway through my yarn

00:29:48.490 00:29:51.480
when I finished the body scared me and I

00:29:52.390 00:29:53.390
stopped dead last night

00:29:54.400 00:29:57.270
how am I gonna get more of George and I

00:29:57.460 00:29:59.670
did the math and I looked at my pattern

00:30:00.190 00:30:02.910
and what I found interesting about my

00:30:03.340 00:30:05.600
pattern and my initial math because

00:30:06.610 00:30:08.340
clearly my head was not screwed on when

00:30:08.410 00:30:12.090
I cast this on I go through and I circle

00:30:12.130 00:30:13.830
the instructions for the size that I've

00:30:14.080 00:30:19.620
chosen and I actively circled the

00:30:20.350 00:30:24.150
yardage that I would need or right there

00:30:25.120 00:30:27.300
the yardage that I would need for the

00:30:27.730 00:30:29.370
size that I was doing except it's not

00:30:31.600 00:30:34.320
it's the meter edge the yardage is

00:30:34.840 00:30:38.700
listed down secondary to it so although

00:30:38.740 00:30:44.100
I circled 15:30 thinking yards because I

00:30:44.890 00:30:45.630
work in yards

00:30:45.670 00:30:48.090
I actually circled in 15 30 meters and

00:30:48.760 00:30:54.390
the yardage is 1485 that's there's a

00:30:54.970 00:30:55.770
significant difference in those numbers

00:30:56.560 00:30:57.950
so I pulled out my skeins and I

00:30:58.020 00:30:59.870
I looked at the yardage reaches gain and

00:31:01.610 00:31:05.630
I have plenty I have plenty and then of

00:31:05.669 00:31:07.519
course I did that other secondary panic

00:31:07.679 00:31:11.029
that designers do where we go there's

00:31:11.669 00:31:13.430
generally a 10% variance from one

00:31:13.679 00:31:16.850
knitter to the other I can't remember if

00:31:17.100 00:31:21.260
this is on gauge or if I'm doing the

00:31:21.510 00:31:23.000
size appropriate to the gauge I got

00:31:23.309 00:31:27.260
because I like the fabric even with the

00:31:27.450 00:31:31.340
10 percent variance I'm good so I'm in

00:31:31.470 00:31:31.730
good shape

00:31:31.919 00:31:34.039
and I'm soldiering on probably and

00:31:34.529 00:31:36.470
excitedly and although I won't be

00:31:36.659 00:31:39.789
wearing this sweater for spring because

00:31:40.799 00:31:43.909
as many of the Americans watching know

00:31:44.429 00:31:46.700
and some Canadians we have not had

00:31:47.250 00:31:50.269
spring we have had winter and we're just

00:31:50.399 00:31:51.769
gonna skip spring and go read this on

00:31:52.470 00:31:55.180
it's either snowing or it's 80 and

00:31:56.190 00:31:58.370
whatever whatever so I think this will

00:31:58.500 00:32:00.470
be very pretty in the fall and I'm

00:32:00.779 00:32:02.659
looking forward to wearing it with brown

00:32:03.380 00:32:06.740
corduroy and turtlenecks and a nice

00:32:07.020 00:32:11.840
olive green Chino and I I love this

00:32:12.299 00:32:14.240
sweater I love it I love the yarn I love

00:32:14.340 00:32:15.710
the sweater I love the whole thing and I

00:32:15.990 00:32:17.570
can't wait to finish it to show you guys

00:32:17.940 00:32:20.630
I do highly recommend Josie Paquin's

00:32:21.059 00:32:23.419
patterns they are beautiful I knit her

00:32:23.850 00:32:27.200
Jen pattern for your hands dropping

00:32:27.360 00:32:29.330
things and now I'm knitting this pattern

00:32:30.440 00:32:34.850
and it's a delight it's a delight very

00:32:35.460 00:32:38.750
well-written nice construction one of

00:32:38.850 00:32:40.820
the things that oddly I find myself

00:32:41.429 00:32:43.340
looking for in sweater patterns I do

00:32:43.740 00:32:46.010
like the in the round seamless top-down

00:32:46.940 00:32:51.320
construction what I hate and I don't

00:32:51.870 00:32:53.240
like to use the word hate it's really

00:32:53.490 00:32:54.919
really strong and really judgmental but

00:32:55.110 00:32:59.180
I hate patterns that use instructions at

00:32:59.340 00:33:04.100
the same time it's not about the pattern

00:33:04.500 00:33:06.230
it's not about the pattern it's about me

00:33:07.130 00:33:10.760
I at the same time now mind you I

00:33:12.049 00:33:14.360
I multitask great I'm doing laundry and

00:33:14.580 00:33:17.860
dishes right now at the same time

00:33:19.100 00:33:22.970
however when I'm knitting I'm kind of a

00:33:23.340 00:33:26.480
single instruction girl okay when I have

00:33:26.610 00:33:29.630
to think about armholes and v-necks and

00:33:32.690 00:33:36.650
I get overwhelmed I get stressed I start

00:33:36.750 00:33:41.450
to question things I I fall apart I fall

00:33:41.760 00:33:43.730
apart at the same time scares me to

00:33:45.950 00:33:48.799
so her patterns don't have that they

00:33:48.990 00:33:52.940
don't have that it's it's really about

00:33:53.429 00:33:54.409
delivery it's about how it's written

00:33:55.049 00:33:57.230
there are things that I'm doing at the

00:33:57.510 00:34:00.590
same time but because we're not saying

00:34:01.049 00:34:02.270
at the same time instead we're just

00:34:02.669 00:34:04.760
giving a linear instruction I can handle

00:34:04.890 00:34:06.680
it no problem it's really about

00:34:07.500 00:34:09.560
presentation and if you have pattern

00:34:10.139 00:34:12.230
fears if you've got some instructions

00:34:12.389 00:34:16.190
that just make you go look for patterns

00:34:16.350 00:34:18.740
that don't do that they're out there

00:34:19.379 00:34:22.700
they're out there so next in line

00:34:23.129 00:34:25.310
marching through my parade are the

00:34:25.830 00:34:28.159
Townies you know them they're all the

00:34:28.859 00:34:29.629
businesses and things that you're

00:34:29.850 00:34:32.119
familiar with and they're always there

00:34:32.159 00:34:34.399
and they're reliable and you can turn to

00:34:34.530 00:34:37.280
them if you need them and but you don't

00:34:37.470 00:34:38.260
see them every day

00:34:39.270 00:34:40.490
you miss them you wish you could see

00:34:40.590 00:34:42.050
them every day but you know see them

00:34:42.210 00:34:48.470
every day in that list I have my day one

00:34:49.440 00:34:52.430
hey I grab the right back alright my day

00:34:52.770 00:34:57.740
one sweater is my purple acrylic sweater

00:34:58.740 00:35:00.470
the daelin pattern

00:35:00.570 00:35:04.400
is a pay-to-play pattern that I bought

00:35:04.590 00:35:09.380
on Ravelry see I'm so sorry I should

00:35:09.570 00:35:11.599
know the names of all my designers and I

00:35:12.660 00:35:16.250
Isabel Kramer really pretty design sorry

00:35:16.680 00:35:18.830
this has been smashed into my project

00:35:19.140 00:35:20.690
baggage carried with me it's a pretty

00:35:21.119 00:35:22.700
design it's knit in the round top-down

00:35:23.310 00:35:27.170
seamless and it has garter stitch all

00:35:27.240 00:35:29.870
the way down the back and it has an

00:35:30.420 00:35:32.240
interesting angle that comes from under

00:35:32.369 00:35:35.630
the arm toward the front where the

00:35:36.030 00:35:38.300
Garter comes around at an angle on the

00:35:38.550 00:35:40.370
front that's very slimming is very nice

00:35:40.680 00:35:42.410
and the front is regular stockinette and

00:35:42.540 00:35:44.599
the sleeve is regular stockinette but it

00:35:44.820 00:35:46.400
just has this angle that comes around

00:35:46.800 00:35:49.490
that from the front Slim's the body line

00:35:49.950 00:35:52.609
I don't know how well you can see that

00:35:53.100 00:35:55.130
there's kind of a close picture of the

00:35:55.590 00:35:58.340
photo certainly look at it online

00:35:58.740 00:36:01.460
this schematic indicates where that

00:36:01.950 00:36:05.150
angle comes in and it just trims the

00:36:05.790 00:36:08.290
waistline for you it's very pretty

00:36:09.300 00:36:11.780
well written pattern easy to do I'm

00:36:12.330 00:36:15.170
doing it in my vanna's choice in purple

00:36:15.530 00:36:17.870
I need an everyday sweater I need a

00:36:18.210 00:36:21.109
sweater that after work when I come home

00:36:21.359 00:36:24.470
and I throw on my PG PJ bottoms and I

00:36:24.840 00:36:27.020
usually throw on a fleece or some kind

00:36:27.119 00:36:28.609
of sweater or something something that

00:36:28.830 00:36:31.940
can stand up to dinner on the sofa half

00:36:32.280 00:36:36.620
asleep and my dogs and this is it I have

00:36:36.750 00:36:39.140
the yarn on hand I'm excited to work

00:36:39.420 00:36:41.720
with it finally it's been in my store

00:36:42.119 00:36:47.690
forever and here it is I haven't got

00:36:47.880 00:36:49.340
much further than the last time I talked

00:36:49.500 00:36:51.290
to you guys about it I need to do a

00:36:51.869 00:36:54.290
couple more rounds before I divide it

00:36:54.660 00:36:57.710
are off the arms in the body I have like

00:36:57.840 00:37:00.010
I said a deep armhole measurement and

00:37:01.020 00:37:04.400
the gauge on this is different then I

00:37:05.190 00:37:06.320
normally get with the same

00:37:06.690 00:37:09.230
in wool on the same needles first off

00:37:09.450 00:37:10.730
it's a little bit heavier than a worse

00:37:10.980 00:37:13.220
is closer doing Aaron I am knitting it

00:37:14.130 00:37:16.280
relatively dense I do want a nice thick

00:37:16.650 00:37:19.220
sweater I get cold and I am not talking

00:37:19.260 00:37:22.310
oh I'm chilly I'm talking I have an

00:37:22.680 00:37:25.280
electric blanket on my sofa in my spot

00:37:25.650 00:37:29.150
and I put on wool socks and I usually

00:37:29.340 00:37:31.670
wear a big thick sweater as well as my

00:37:32.310 00:37:35.570
thermal jammy bottoms and I will still

00:37:36.000 00:37:40.330
shake I get cold part of that is me

00:37:41.340 00:37:42.260
detoxing the stress of my work

00:37:42.660 00:37:44.510
environment and coming home

00:37:44.610 00:37:47.990
and part of it is I just I'm one of

00:37:48.120 00:37:49.790
those people I don't retain weight well

00:37:50.010 00:37:52.610
oh wait I retain weight just fine

00:37:52.650 00:37:56.450
I don't retain heat well so I'm excited

00:37:56.670 00:37:59.720
to have a nice thick bulky big sweater

00:38:00.090 00:38:02.210
and I love the color I love the color

00:38:02.430 00:38:04.760
it's not the best color on me I love it

00:38:04.890 00:38:09.620
I on carrots for me at home the gauge

00:38:10.020 00:38:11.660
also is affected not only by the

00:38:12.570 00:38:14.410
variants in the in the general weight

00:38:15.420 00:38:17.450
but also in that it's acrylic and

00:38:18.450 00:38:20.350
acrylic ultimately wants to stay

00:38:21.360 00:38:22.940
straight it's a plastic product it

00:38:23.280 00:38:25.940
doesn't want to bend and curl much like

00:38:26.550 00:38:28.640
it was on the animal where was bendy and

00:38:29.220 00:38:32.870
curly like a wool does so that that does

00:38:33.120 00:38:35.510
affect it affects your rawhide

00:38:35.970 00:38:38.630
interestingly enough so a couple more

00:38:38.820 00:38:41.240
rounds on this and maybe it'll move

00:38:41.730 00:38:43.130
forward into the marching band section

00:38:43.380 00:38:45.140
of the parade but right now it's in the

00:38:45.390 00:38:46.820
townie selection where it's just kind of

00:38:47.130 00:38:53.170
hanging out I'm enjoying it I love it I

00:38:54.180 00:38:56.210
if I had eight hands I could get so much

00:38:56.430 00:38:59.360
more knitting done I really could also

00:39:00.030 00:39:03.230
in the towny section of my parade is my

00:39:04.020 00:39:07.190
adventurous wrap I love this design I

00:39:07.620 00:39:11.110
love this design this is available on

00:39:12.120 00:39:15.370
Ravelry the designer is Amba O'Brien

00:39:15.470 00:39:17.920
and it is a really neat construction

00:39:18.200 00:39:21.430
where she is taking two triangular

00:39:21.920 00:39:23.230
shawls and putting them together to make

00:39:23.360 00:39:26.800
a giant rhombus wrap and I don't have a

00:39:27.170 00:39:29.830
great picture for you that's what it is

00:39:30.670 00:39:33.760
I refer to this on my project page as my

00:39:34.010 00:39:37.420
I blame Carolyn because my dear friend

00:39:37.970 00:39:40.030
Carolyn knit one of these in advance of

00:39:40.190 00:39:42.610
me and I loved her so much that I ran

00:39:42.920 00:39:44.920
and played with yarns and sorted out my

00:39:45.470 00:39:49.000
colors it's kind of a fade it's written

00:39:49.280 00:39:51.880
for I believe either 5 or 7 cut no I'm

00:39:52.520 00:39:54.700
sorry it's an advent calendar it's

00:39:55.010 00:39:59.640
written to be used with up to 25 colors

00:40:00.650 00:40:03.010
it's it's beautiful I love it I love it

00:40:03.260 00:40:08.410
I am exactly 50% exactly 50% and I love

00:40:08.600 00:40:12.130
the colors that I used I ever amazed at

00:40:12.230 00:40:14.380
how different they look on camera than

00:40:14.510 00:40:16.570
they look on person the camera just

00:40:17.120 00:40:18.280
punches it up and makes it look really

00:40:18.710 00:40:21.520
really stripy whereas in person it's a

00:40:21.980 00:40:23.920
little bit more blended but maybe it's

00:40:24.290 00:40:26.320
precise this perspective who knows it's

00:40:26.600 00:40:28.510
lovely I am very excited about it I

00:40:28.730 00:40:32.170
can't wear wait to wear it this is going

00:40:32.240 00:40:34.360
to end up living I I suspect in my

00:40:34.670 00:40:37.900
office at work because I work in a

00:40:38.060 00:40:39.610
hospital and they're pretty convinced

00:40:39.650 00:40:41.650
that the temperature constantly needs to

00:40:41.810 00:40:44.740
be between 68 and 70 degrees and I

00:40:45.320 00:40:48.790
ultimately live very happily at 76 to 78

00:40:48.860 00:40:51.340
degrees I'm always cold I'm always cold

00:40:51.620 00:40:53.530
and that temperature does not change

00:40:54.260 00:40:56.980
winter to summer I do have a progress

00:40:57.410 00:40:59.050
marker in it from the last time I showed

00:40:59.330 00:41:01.540
it to you to where I am progress marker

00:41:01.700 00:41:06.430
is right here so I did about that much

00:41:06.740 00:41:07.690
of the triangle

00:41:07.730 00:41:11.080
I get that side bound off and the side

00:41:11.480 00:41:13.120
is open and waiting for the next

00:41:13.880 00:41:15.070
instruction and I need to knit the other

00:41:15.890 00:41:17.860
triangle I was very excited the other

00:41:18.020 00:41:19.990
night I came running in here thinking oh

00:41:20.360 00:41:22.960
I'm can I cast that second half on and

00:41:23.420 00:41:24.640
get that moving I want to get this done

00:41:24.950 00:41:26.140
because right now it's really really

00:41:26.360 00:41:27.890
chilly in my office at work think

00:41:27.990 00:41:29.000
the air conditioner on and the

00:41:29.339 00:41:31.460
temperature outside is still going 60 80

00:41:31.890 00:41:36.740
60 it doesn't know so I ran in here I

00:41:37.440 00:41:39.980
grabbed my project bag with all the

00:41:40.319 00:41:42.109
yarns and everything I looked real quick

00:41:42.270 00:41:47.000
at this and I have the miscellaneous

00:41:47.609 00:41:52.250
pages don't relate to the option that

00:41:52.619 00:41:53.960
I'm knitting the pattern has a couple of

00:41:54.210 00:41:58.760
different options and I have no idea

00:41:59.309 00:42:02.480
whatsoever where am i working option

00:42:03.210 00:42:08.930
pattern is none I've dug around I've

00:42:09.359 00:42:13.730
cleaned I I'm still you know when you

00:42:14.010 00:42:16.279
lose something you start looking for it

00:42:16.410 00:42:18.559
and until you resolve that problem until

00:42:18.690 00:42:20.569
you find it or until you have given up

00:42:20.730 00:42:21.470
and replaced it

00:42:21.869 00:42:23.660
you keep looking your subconscious is

00:42:24.119 00:42:25.339
still and you get like antsy

00:42:25.799 00:42:27.769
I'm still there it's been 2 days of it's

00:42:28.349 00:42:29.809
nonsense I need to just print off the

00:42:29.910 00:42:33.279
other copies and then I can test it on

00:42:34.289 00:42:35.539
when I'm gonna do this I don't know I

00:42:36.210 00:42:41.180
don't know I'm dreaming I think also in

00:42:41.339 00:42:43.549
the Townies section of my parade and

00:42:44.250 00:42:45.890
again these are the the reliables

00:42:46.109 00:42:47.660
they're always there they're satisfying

00:42:48.089 00:42:50.630
knit it's something that I can go to

00:42:51.150 00:42:55.010
when I need it and you kind of take me

00:42:55.230 00:42:58.220
for granted unfortunately in my townie

00:42:58.710 00:43:03.620
parade selection I have of course my how

00:43:03.690 00:43:06.289
to eat an elephant blanket I'm not even

00:43:06.420 00:43:10.309
gonna bother opening it it's it's tied

00:43:10.349 00:43:12.829
to the basket the work basket that all

00:43:13.020 00:43:15.589
my scraps are in this is my fingering

00:43:16.380 00:43:21.200
oh it's getting dusty ah oh I need to

00:43:22.220 00:43:24.470
either package this in a project bet

00:43:24.690 00:43:28.460
it's got dog hair on it whoa I don't

00:43:28.529 00:43:29.750
know why this bothers me it's not like

00:43:30.059 00:43:31.130
it's not gonna have dogs err on it when

00:43:31.170 00:43:34.539
I use it um

00:43:35.549 00:43:37.440
this is reality folks

00:43:38.410 00:43:40.559
it's a fingering weight blanket and I'm

00:43:41.049 00:43:44.099
doing it with black frames worked in my

00:43:44.680 00:43:48.329
project page on Ravelry does have all of

00:43:48.489 00:43:50.099
my notes so that you can do the same

00:43:50.410 00:43:52.049
thing it's not a pattern so much as it

00:43:52.089 00:43:55.079
is a formula certainly if you love the

00:43:55.269 00:43:57.479
look of this and you're not on Ravelry

00:43:57.789 00:44:00.120
you're welcome to email me and I will

00:44:00.700 00:44:03.089
send you a copy of the formula but I'm

00:44:03.400 00:44:05.849
using leftover bits of sock yarn and I'm

00:44:06.309 00:44:08.009
framing them in black so it's very much

00:44:08.200 00:44:09.420
like stained glass

00:44:09.940 00:44:13.710
it is not modular so much as I'm making

00:44:13.900 00:44:15.599
the individual squares and sewing them

00:44:15.730 00:44:17.549
together it's a pick up an add-on

00:44:18.369 00:44:19.859
project so each one of these squares I'm

00:44:20.170 00:44:22.019
picking up stitches and I work just that

00:44:22.480 00:44:23.729
square and then I pick up stitches and I

00:44:23.920 00:44:27.029
work just that square I refer to it as

00:44:27.069 00:44:28.589
my how to eat an elephant blanket

00:44:28.930 00:44:31.470
because an elephant one bite at a time

00:44:32.049 00:44:35.870
and each one of these is one bite a

00:44:37.269 00:44:39.359
I have timed out if I'm watching TV and

00:44:39.489 00:44:41.370
I'm not aggressively working on it takes

00:44:41.619 00:44:46.920
anywhere between 45 to an hour I love

00:44:47.079 00:44:49.710
them I enjoy it so much every one of

00:44:49.839 00:44:51.599
these squares has a memory attached to

00:44:51.789 00:44:55.229
it and it just makes me happy it's gonna

00:44:55.420 00:44:58.079
be a great big beautiful blanket I have

00:44:58.329 00:45:00.630
not worked on it in a long time and I do

00:45:00.970 00:45:02.640
have guilt about that I can't even

00:45:02.799 00:45:04.079
believe it's starting to get dusty that

00:45:04.480 00:45:06.599
means it's been sitting way too long and

00:45:06.849 00:45:08.489
I need to at least give it a shake out

00:45:08.650 00:45:11.880
and a refold but now that I'm knitting

00:45:12.609 00:45:17.279
actively again it sits by my spot and I

00:45:17.739 00:45:19.950
need to try to get back on it otherwise

00:45:20.440 00:45:21.809
I'm not gonna live long enough to finish

00:45:22.119 00:45:26.220
this it's I have really an aggressive

00:45:26.589 00:45:28.229
idea of how big I want the end product

00:45:28.269 00:45:30.829
to be so I need to get to work on it

00:45:31.839 00:45:34.349
that's that's moving on nicely how many

00:45:34.839 00:45:35.910
projects have I talked to you guys about

00:45:36.489 00:45:39.420
one two three four five six seven seven

00:45:40.680 00:45:42.539
ways we're only halfway through the

00:45:45.619 00:45:50.839
um next in line is that elusive girl

00:45:51.269 00:45:55.910
with the pretty smile the waves at the

00:45:56.219 00:45:59.890
crowd as she goes by on her float and

00:46:00.900 00:46:03.200
she's been crowned she's important

00:46:04.019 00:46:08.989
but she's unattainable somehow yeah my

00:46:09.269 00:46:10.819
view of parades is probably kind of

00:46:11.450 00:46:15.140
slanted that particular project it's not

00:46:15.359 00:46:18.890
on the needles and I feel kind of bad

00:46:18.960 00:46:20.870
about calling it a whip because I need

00:46:20.910 00:46:25.339
to at least cast it on its the farmhouse

00:46:26.509 00:46:29.890
shawl y'all have seen me wear this

00:46:30.900 00:46:32.989
there's a hand-spun in here if I

00:46:33.479 00:46:36.410
remember correctly and because it is not

00:46:37.759 00:46:41.059
a widely available yarn the gauge is

00:46:41.160 00:46:44.539
going to be different and there are a

00:46:44.849 00:46:47.690
couple of notes from my pattern design

00:46:47.910 00:46:50.329
that are missing that I need to sort out

00:46:51.049 00:46:53.029
and the only way that I'm going to

00:46:53.279 00:46:55.670
correct the gauge and correct this

00:46:56.190 00:47:00.499
missing note is to remit it I love this

00:47:00.900 00:47:02.329
design this is one of my favorite

00:47:02.609 00:47:07.309
designs it is a well it's a three-sided

00:47:07.650 00:47:11.089
square ultimately with a hole in the

00:47:11.849 00:47:15.469
designed in so that it wraps beautifully

00:47:15.930 00:47:19.519
around in a number of ways and it has a

00:47:19.739 00:47:21.170
little bit of lace it has a little bit

00:47:21.239 00:47:25.249
of striping it's warm it's lovely it's

00:47:25.739 00:47:27.769
flexible it's comfortable it can be

00:47:28.109 00:47:30.319
dressed up dressed down tucked under a

00:47:31.049 00:47:33.620
jacket and just because of the way I

00:47:34.349 00:47:35.680
handled the neck

00:47:35.930 00:47:37.690
it fits and drapes better than your

00:47:38.440 00:47:43.060
average triangular wrap whatever I am

00:47:43.400 00:47:46.690
very excited about this design not

00:47:47.150 00:47:48.100
excited enough apparently because I

00:47:48.290 00:47:49.990
haven't cast it on yet and there are a

00:47:50.510 00:47:53.410
number of you thank you for staying on

00:47:53.630 00:47:56.140
me thank you it actually helps going

00:47:56.960 00:47:58.150
when is that gonna be available for

00:47:58.340 00:48:01.570
testing I really love that I really I'd

00:48:01.790 00:48:03.510
be more than happy to test that point I

00:48:04.520 00:48:08.040
know I really want to keep it to you

00:48:09.050 00:48:10.720
it's that elusive girl in the parade

00:48:10.760 00:48:13.090
that they crowned the parade Quinn set

00:48:13.790 00:48:16.660
princess or queen and she's she's waving

00:48:16.820 00:48:19.150
and she's she's going by on her float

00:48:19.460 00:48:22.210
and it's totally unattainable we're

00:48:22.430 00:48:24.120
gonna get there we are gonna get there I

00:48:29.020 00:48:34.450
am we're doing a design along and I have

00:48:34.490 00:48:36.970
a deadline on our group design along it

00:48:37.580 00:48:39.580
anybody can jump in any time feel free

00:48:40.430 00:48:43.420
we did a vote and we picked a theme and

00:48:43.610 00:48:46.870
our theme is connection and that means a

00:48:47.120 00:48:49.690
lot to me I am thrilled at the

00:48:50.360 00:48:52.480
participation that we've had I'm excited

00:48:52.640 00:48:54.580
to see what you guys do please go over

00:48:55.310 00:48:58.210
to the threads on Ravelry and post your

00:48:58.880 00:49:01.270
progress or join in the conversation

00:49:01.670 00:49:04.630
about how your design process works how

00:49:04.850 00:49:07.360
your brain works so we're curious I'm

00:49:07.640 00:49:09.100
always interested in seeing how other

00:49:09.410 00:49:14.380
people think ultimately I feel like I

00:49:14.720 00:49:16.360
should be doing a new and unique design

00:49:16.940 00:49:18.820
in order to participate in this however

00:49:19.700 00:49:22.090
even in my own rules I said that it

00:49:22.280 00:49:24.070
could be something that you already have

00:49:24.200 00:49:26.860
in process at any various stage that you

00:49:27.260 00:49:29.070
just need to flesh all the way out and

00:49:30.080 00:49:33.040
ultimately what we need is a completed

00:49:33.200 00:49:36.640
end product whether it is a hat or socks

00:49:37.070 00:49:41.380
or a scarf or a cow whatever you decide

00:49:41.800 00:49:46.000
to enter in the drawing for the giveaway

00:49:46.340 00:49:46.890
at the

00:49:47.200 00:49:49.800
the design along all you need to have by

00:49:50.590 00:49:53.790
September 1st is a completed object that

00:49:54.040 00:49:57.470
you have designed easy enough right

00:49:58.480 00:50:00.660
I've had it in my head that I should be

00:50:00.940 00:50:02.610
doing a new and unique design that you

00:50:02.770 00:50:04.050
guys have never seen before

00:50:07.860 00:50:11.010
I have a connection to you folks and I

00:50:11.170 00:50:12.150
have a number of people that have

00:50:12.310 00:50:14.130
reached out to me that want to connect

00:50:14.380 00:50:17.550
with this pattern and I have a

00:50:17.920 00:50:23.550
connection to it I want to do it and I

00:50:23.950 00:50:25.110
keep putting it aside for other

00:50:29.010 00:50:32.400
priorities right here right now here it

00:50:32.500 00:50:34.920
is guys I'm making the decision this is

00:50:35.260 00:50:38.490
it here it is this is going to be my

00:50:39.130 00:50:44.490
design project and as I'm burbling here

00:50:44.770 00:50:47.960
and trying to flesh out what my

00:50:48.970 00:50:50.370
definition is what I need to dedicate

00:50:50.560 00:50:54.510
myself to part of this was that when I

00:50:55.240 00:50:58.670
died up some yarns for it I had dyed

00:50:59.680 00:51:02.310
colors that it wasn't just a pair of

00:51:02.890 00:51:04.620
colors and there were a couple of

00:51:04.900 00:51:06.840
options that were three color options

00:51:07.480 00:51:09.330
and I was saying at the time that I

00:51:09.640 00:51:12.240
would like to redesign this pattern so

00:51:12.280 00:51:14.670
that you had the option of either a two

00:51:15.070 00:51:19.680
or three color option here it is I'm

00:51:20.260 00:51:22.140
throwing down the gauntlet for all the

00:51:22.540 00:51:25.200
ideas that I've had for new designs this

00:51:25.390 00:51:27.480
is gonna be my priority I am going to

00:51:28.000 00:51:30.060
finish this pattern design I'm going to

00:51:30.730 00:51:34.590
remit this and my goal uh-huh I'm not

00:51:35.350 00:51:37.980
scaring myself is to knit not only the

00:51:38.320 00:51:40.980
to color version but the three color

00:51:41.680 00:51:46.770
version for September first I don't

00:51:47.290 00:51:51.630
remember hitting my head and I made my

00:51:51.700 00:51:52.890
own breakfast so I'm pretty sure I

00:51:53.290 00:51:55.830
haven't been poisoned or drugged but

00:51:56.290 00:51:57.780
here it is this is what we're gonna do

00:51:57.970 00:51:59.910
so the farmhouse shawl is going to

00:52:00.190 00:52:05.490
my connection design project I'm gonna

00:52:05.740 00:52:06.750
pull the pieces together we're going to

00:52:06.850 00:52:08.010
do this we're going to do this there it

00:52:08.170 00:52:10.290
is okay the elusive girl in the parade

00:52:10.600 00:52:12.450
is going to be my design project and

00:52:13.210 00:52:17.580
with a little luck because I'm ambitious

00:52:17.920 00:52:21.420
and crazy I will have time to do another

00:52:21.880 00:52:25.560
design as well I hear you laughing it's

00:52:26.460 00:52:29.670
okay all right the next stage of your

00:52:30.100 00:52:32.430
parade is the fire and rescue with their

00:52:32.950 00:52:34.410
blaring horns and showing off their

00:52:34.930 00:52:36.330
really cool new equipment and everything

00:52:36.670 00:52:37.740
and they're trying to get your attention

00:52:38.650 00:52:40.410
but you don't use them very often we

00:52:40.660 00:52:44.580
hope and so they are really quite

00:52:45.430 00:52:46.860
forgotten but when you look at them you

00:52:47.050 00:52:49.560
get the earth and you realize oh I

00:52:49.870 00:52:52.050
really should pay attention to this on

00:52:52.900 00:52:54.930
that list of wonderful things in my

00:52:55.390 00:52:57.570
parade we're gonna start with the one

00:52:57.640 00:53:01.910
that blares at me the loudest another

00:53:02.920 00:53:06.630
fantastic pattern I absolutely adore the

00:53:06.880 00:53:10.640
work of Zandi Peters her brain works in

00:53:11.650 00:53:14.820
ways and directions that I only wish I

00:53:14.860 00:53:19.590
had the time to explore I wish my brain

00:53:19.870 00:53:20.910
worked that way I wish I was that

00:53:21.520 00:53:23.490
innovative in my pattern design zandi's

00:53:23.860 00:53:25.680
designs art and gorgeous and one of her

00:53:26.290 00:53:28.380
earlier patterns I'm sure she has a

00:53:28.960 00:53:30.350
plethora of patterns since then I do

00:53:31.360 00:53:32.700
follow her and I see her stuff on

00:53:32.860 00:53:34.950
Instagram and her knitting goes in every

00:53:35.140 00:53:37.380
direction possible the beauty of her

00:53:37.630 00:53:40.830
work is that she creates a color work

00:53:41.470 00:53:46.190
with a very strong visual punch that is

00:53:47.200 00:53:49.740
I'm not gonna say easy to achieve but

00:53:49.930 00:53:51.810
the color work doesn't require stranding

00:53:52.360 00:53:54.240
you're only working one color at a time

00:53:54.750 00:53:57.750
and because of the stacked increases and

00:53:57.910 00:54:00.230
decreases techniques that she uses you

00:54:01.240 00:54:02.250
get in

00:54:02.830 00:54:05.220
visual punch this was one of her earlier

00:54:05.680 00:54:08.880
designs it is called Fox pause and I

00:54:09.450 00:54:14.510
have worked on it with some gusto

00:54:15.520 00:54:17.460
initially and I am a couplet repeats in

00:54:17.770 00:54:20.160
and I love this it's ultimately going to

00:54:20.380 00:54:25.800
be a wide scarf or kind of a wrap the

00:54:26.560 00:54:29.820
colors turn me on I chose these I love

00:54:30.040 00:54:40.890
them they are very 70s kitchen

00:54:41.410 00:54:43.890
there's eggplant and there is a laqad oh

00:54:44.410 00:54:46.470
and there's a chartreuse and a mustard

00:54:46.780 00:54:50.460
and a burnt orange in here and I love

00:54:50.890 00:54:53.430
the way the stitches interplay I'm

00:54:53.980 00:54:55.500
showing it to you sideways this is

00:54:55.990 00:54:58.070
actually how the knitting progresses

00:54:59.640 00:55:01.800
it's beautiful it's beautiful and you

00:55:02.050 00:55:05.400
only work one color at a time I'm so

00:55:05.770 00:55:08.970
turned on by this I love this I want to

00:55:09.160 00:55:11.220
work on this for two years now I've been

00:55:11.410 00:55:13.170
thinking oh I can't wait to wear this

00:55:13.450 00:55:15.870
this winter I love the visual I think

00:55:16.000 00:55:17.970
it's gonna be chest up beautiful

00:55:19.800 00:55:24.150
accessory it is a pay freaking attention

00:55:24.700 00:55:29.610
pattern and I'm not even joking I think

00:55:29.860 00:55:32.790
she has since come out with charting to

00:55:33.490 00:55:35.330
handle the increases and decreases

00:55:36.340 00:55:38.310
because it is stacked and visually to

00:55:38.560 00:55:44.670
chart this is complex so unfortunately

00:55:45.520 00:55:46.560
and I should check to see if there's

00:55:46.630 00:55:48.350
been an update to the pattern but

00:55:49.360 00:55:53.040
unfortunately it is written out line for

00:55:53.370 00:55:56.040
line I'm sorry I would show you life

00:55:56.440 00:55:58.020
aligned but I cannot remember if this is

00:55:58.060 00:56:02.550
a pay-to-play or not and the line for

00:56:02.820 00:56:06.570
line has because it's a unique technique

00:56:06.850 00:56:10.650
it has some complex abbreviations in it

00:56:11.380 00:56:12.790
like Kyo

00:56:15.340 00:56:25.240
sb2 versus k5 together SB k3 tog there's

00:56:25.520 00:56:29.110
just a lot of knit together and creating

00:56:29.920 00:56:31.810
and repeats and there's a ton of

00:56:32.540 00:56:33.610
brackets and you know do this

00:56:34.460 00:56:37.570
instruction two times three times four

00:56:37.690 00:56:40.510
times five times so it's complex its

00:56:40.880 00:56:45.330
complex it is not ultimately difficult

00:56:46.340 00:56:48.460
now that I'm scared you have to do it's

00:56:48.620 00:56:50.980
not ultimately difficult I'm a visual

00:56:51.410 00:56:53.710
knitter and I love charts

00:56:53.750 00:56:56.860
I love charts I am NOT a big fan of

00:56:57.350 00:56:59.860
written instruction by the time I

00:57:00.440 00:57:02.080
focused on the right line and figured

00:57:02.150 00:57:06.610
out where in that line I am I go back to

00:57:06.740 00:57:10.600
my knitting and I I get confused I did I

00:57:10.820 00:57:11.920
already do this

00:57:12.620 00:57:14.110
okay reads right did this I did this I

00:57:14.150 00:57:15.670
did this I need to do this instruction

00:57:16.070 00:57:17.770
next I go back wait a minute was that

00:57:17.990 00:57:21.130
or maybe I okay I've done this this yeah

00:57:21.290 00:57:22.390
I'm reading my knitting and I'm reading

00:57:22.610 00:57:26.950
me yeah I hate it I hate it I much

00:57:27.380 00:57:29.650
prefer to see the visual representation

00:57:30.050 00:57:31.260
in front me and cede the chart

00:57:32.270 00:57:33.250
representation and convert between those

00:57:33.440 00:57:34.750
two and it makes more sense that's just

00:57:34.940 00:57:37.630
how my brain works so I need to check

00:57:37.880 00:57:40.330
and see if maybe she's done a chart

00:57:40.790 00:57:42.520
update on this so that I can get the

00:57:42.830 00:57:45.430
chart on it would be easier for me to do

00:57:45.760 00:57:52.540
I think I'm three reps in and I think I

00:57:52.820 00:57:59.560
have I don't know I have a lot to go I

00:57:59.690 00:58:01.480
have a lot to go I mean that's that's

00:58:01.910 00:58:07.540
hardly a wrap it's 16 inches I need to

00:58:07.760 00:58:10.930
do this at least four maybe five more

00:58:11.260 00:58:15.490
times I want to work on it

00:58:16.280 00:58:18.340
part of my hesitation is like I said

00:58:18.620 00:58:20.220
it's a freaking attention

00:58:20.950 00:58:23.310
each row there there's a few rows that

00:58:23.380 00:58:25.710
are pretty straight and easy that only

00:58:26.050 00:58:28.830
take a few you know paths or there's

00:58:29.080 00:58:30.570
other roads that we're taking me 45

00:58:30.880 00:58:33.240
minutes a row because of me having to

00:58:33.580 00:58:35.910
relate to it I need to sit down I need

00:58:36.010 00:58:38.370
to figure out where I left off I need to

00:58:38.619 00:58:40.080
read my knitting I need to figure out

00:58:40.240 00:58:42.480
what line I was on before I can pick up

00:58:42.760 00:58:45.810
again I know that that's an hour of my

00:58:45.850 00:58:49.050
life right there and once I have that

00:58:49.240 00:58:50.609
hour of my life accomplished where I

00:58:50.890 00:58:52.710
sort out where I am and where I'm headed

00:58:53.590 00:58:55.380
then I'm a little terrified that the

00:58:55.630 00:58:58.050
next row was one of the 45-minute rows

00:58:58.869 00:59:00.240
because why would I have stopped where I

00:59:00.609 00:59:02.010
did if I could have just knocked out

00:59:02.320 00:59:04.590
another 15-minute row that's who I am

00:59:04.750 00:59:06.330
that's what I do I stopped at the next

00:59:06.880 00:59:10.230
complex point I really want to do this

00:59:10.869 00:59:13.500
it's a matter of time and I sort of need

00:59:13.840 00:59:16.950
a traffic jam or a long wait in a

00:59:17.410 00:59:19.410
doctor's office or something to push me

00:59:19.570 00:59:22.320
there and even then I would be not in

00:59:22.359 00:59:26.520
the right frame of mind I love this and

00:59:26.619 00:59:31.290
I will someday accomplish it it's on my

00:59:31.780 00:59:33.630
radar it's on my radar I'm gonna do this

00:59:34.980 00:59:44.160
I promise I promise myself also in the

00:59:45.119 00:59:50.460
deep deep projects I have my overflow

00:59:50.940 00:59:54.840
shawl this is also a design in progress

00:59:55.590 00:59:59.030
I have one that is completed that I love

01:00:00.040 01:00:02.130
but I wasn't thrilled with the yarn

01:00:02.560 01:00:05.640
choice that I had or the size that I did

01:00:06.430 01:00:08.130
it's a little bit smaller than I wanted

01:00:08.320 01:00:09.840
it to be

01:00:09.880 01:00:16.830
I am remitting it in another yarn and it

01:00:17.080 01:00:19.380
has been on the needles forever it is

01:00:20.170 01:00:23.099
called overflow it is a bobble shawl in

01:00:23.500 01:00:26.940
a lace of weight it's lovely and it's

01:00:27.780 01:00:29.480
it's once this is locked out it's gonna

01:00:29.580 01:00:33.170
be a nice big beautiful draping shawl it

01:00:33.390 01:00:36.380
is a two colors all it does this

01:00:36.840 01:00:38.540
beautiful bauble textured down through

01:00:38.760 01:00:41.540
it is a three quarter square much like

01:00:41.700 01:00:43.340
the farmhouse but it doesn't have the

01:00:43.620 01:00:46.310
neck cut out here where the farmhouse

01:00:46.590 01:00:50.240
has the the squared cut out this one

01:00:50.460 01:00:53.960
does not and and its size makes up for

01:00:54.150 01:00:56.360
the lack of neck hole so that you've got

01:00:56.580 01:00:59.500
very long arms on it to wrap around with

01:01:00.510 01:01:03.320
it dissolves down from bobbles like Lane

01:01:04.070 01:01:07.250
falling into a wavy pattern at the

01:01:07.770 01:01:13.150
bottom and a lighter color I need to I

01:01:14.160 01:01:15.650
have a couple more reps of the wave

01:01:16.230 01:01:17.990
pattern that need to go on and then the

01:01:18.480 01:01:20.120
final edge which revert back to the

01:01:20.700 01:01:27.320
primary color I'm not entirely sure why

01:01:27.360 01:01:31.010
I stopped where I stopped I said I have

01:01:31.050 01:01:34.280
a suspicion I have a suspicion and the

01:01:34.920 01:01:38.750
suspicion is directly related to I was

01:01:39.180 01:01:40.580
toying with making it change to my

01:01:40.830 01:01:46.400
pattern see my raggedy notes where I was

01:01:47.070 01:01:50.420
thinking that I might do a thicker edge

01:01:51.420 01:01:54.080
in the primary color than the original

01:01:54.360 01:01:56.960
that was going to be more a row and a

01:01:57.180 01:02:02.350
bind off it was a design change

01:02:07.480 01:02:08.609
and I think I was looking for more

01:02:08.920 01:02:11.370
balance rather than having it look like

01:02:12.119 01:02:15.450
I ran out of the master color and just

01:02:15.849 01:02:17.130
tacked on the lighter color at the

01:02:17.339 01:02:19.500
bottom you don't want the pattern to

01:02:19.690 01:02:21.270
look that way I wanted to balance and

01:02:22.240 01:02:23.940
that's why I'm of the belief that it

01:02:24.130 01:02:26.819
needs to have at least two more repeats

01:02:27.010 01:02:29.549
of the lace edge before I do a tie back

01:02:29.920 01:02:33.240
in I'm also thinking based on the notes

01:02:33.400 01:02:35.400
that I reviewed this morning and and a

01:02:35.530 01:02:36.930
little scribbled down at the bottom that

01:02:37.390 01:02:40.559
I was actually thinking about having it

01:02:41.140 01:02:42.599
stripe in a little bit so that there was

01:02:42.849 01:02:45.720
going to be a couple more repeats of the

01:02:45.940 01:02:50.309
light color a thinner line of the we'll

01:02:50.349 01:02:53.280
call it the Navy and then back into the

01:02:53.770 01:02:55.290
seafoam and then the Navy and then the

01:02:55.750 01:02:59.549
seafoam and then the bind off that may

01:02:59.710 01:03:06.870
have been where I was design changes on

01:03:07.030 01:03:11.309
the fly can be wonderful and beautiful

01:03:11.530 01:03:12.720
things come out of it because you're

01:03:13.530 01:03:17.609
seeing the project at full size and that

01:03:17.829 01:03:19.079
gives you a different perspective than

01:03:19.690 01:03:21.870
when you have a swatch and you're trying

01:03:21.940 01:03:23.670
to judge what is this swatch going to

01:03:23.950 01:03:28.609
look like when it is five feet across

01:03:29.619 01:03:32.730
being able to take the project drape it

01:03:32.920 01:03:35.190
over and see where the lines of landings

01:03:35.589 01:03:37.530
see what the visual impact is of the

01:03:38.160 01:03:41.539
striping makes a huge difference and

01:03:42.549 01:03:44.069
adding things are editing on the fly

01:03:44.109 01:03:47.099
like that can make or break a project

01:03:47.950 01:03:56.849
that really can so they can also make or

01:03:56.950 01:03:58.920
break the knitter they can make a rip in

01:04:00.450 01:04:02.870
if I decide to play with this and I'm

01:04:03.359 01:04:05.329
quite sure this is why this was stalled

01:04:07.160 01:04:11.059
I have lifelines thrown in if you're not

01:04:11.279 01:04:13.219
familiar with lifelines a lifeline is

01:04:13.769 01:04:15.559
basically like saving your Word document

01:04:15.719 01:04:17.599
before you make more edits so that if

01:04:17.789 01:04:19.489
you don't like the edits you can go back

01:04:19.650 01:04:21.529
to blast save point really easily

01:04:22.289 01:04:24.829
without having to yeah you can just go

01:04:25.459 01:04:28.009
back and the Lifeline works exactly like

01:04:28.469 01:04:33.049
that I for lace weights like this my

01:04:33.599 01:04:36.380
lifelines are dental floss and I have

01:04:36.809 01:04:38.870
the ability to attach them to the needle

01:04:38.969 01:04:40.729
that I'm using and on the next row

01:04:41.420 01:04:43.819
through take the dental floss in through

01:04:44.190 01:04:46.099
with me and it saves that line so that

01:04:46.559 01:04:48.109
if anything goes wrong after that point

01:04:48.299 01:04:50.809
I can drop back down to that line and

01:04:51.359 01:04:53.539
easily pick up those stitches very

01:04:53.849 01:04:56.390
clever very smart technique I highly

01:04:56.969 01:04:58.249
recommend them if you're making edits to

01:04:58.559 01:05:01.489
say a sweater or if you're designing and

01:05:02.309 01:05:04.130
you're kind of designing on the needles

01:05:04.829 01:05:07.609
use lifelines lifelines if you have a

01:05:07.979 01:05:10.160
new pattern that you're unfamiliar with

01:05:10.739 01:05:12.019
that you're not totally comfortable

01:05:12.690 01:05:13.910
working or if you're working lace for

01:05:13.979 01:05:16.309
the first time use your lifelines put

01:05:16.440 01:05:17.809
them in on one of your restaurants or

01:05:17.940 01:05:19.729
you just happen to only knit or only

01:05:20.099 01:05:21.829
purl across it's nice and easy there

01:05:21.869 01:05:25.999
easy to pick back up for a project of

01:05:26.369 01:05:30.640
this size and I'm gonna make a loose

01:05:31.650 01:05:38.839
eyeball guess I'm gonna say I got 500

01:05:39.269 01:05:41.839
stitches on this I'm gonna say there's

01:05:42.420 01:05:44.569
500 stitches on these needles if there's

01:05:45.029 01:05:49.189
there's a lot there's a lot and that may

01:05:49.259 01:05:50.779
be conservative this may be closer to

01:05:51.059 01:05:52.509
700 stitches

01:05:53.519 01:05:56.870
yes I can throw a lifeline yes I can zap

01:05:57.269 01:05:59.420
across a couple of the Navy throw in a

01:05:59.640 01:06:01.880
couple of the seafoam look at it again

01:06:02.069 01:06:04.579
and go yeah I should have put in three

01:06:04.739 01:06:07.549
rows and pull back and you're talking

01:06:07.829 01:06:10.370
about aa dedicated

01:06:11.310 01:06:13.940
on the needles and I think that's why I

01:06:14.790 01:06:17.150
stopped working on this was I wanted to

01:06:17.400 01:06:18.770
really flesh it out and have it clean in

01:06:18.810 01:06:21.500
my head before I continued knitting and

01:06:23.690 01:06:25.820
notating I've been far enough removed

01:06:26.250 01:06:31.970
from this pattern and I'm talking two

01:06:32.340 01:06:34.820
years this has been sitting by if I had

01:06:34.920 01:06:36.710
to make a loose guess I probably haven't

01:06:36.900 01:06:39.650
touched this in two years I am so far

01:06:39.870 01:06:42.470
removed from my original thought pattern

01:06:42.690 01:06:44.840
on this then I'm actually eager to pick

01:06:45.060 01:06:46.700
this back up because my vision is

01:06:46.950 01:06:49.160
different my goals are different my

01:06:49.590 01:06:51.590
thoughts about it are different and I

01:06:51.630 01:06:53.510
have a different appreciation for the

01:06:53.730 01:06:56.450
work that's gone into this and I'm not

01:06:57.150 01:06:58.850
so mentally stuck on I got to get it

01:06:59.160 01:07:01.430
done I'm more on I'm curious where this

01:07:01.680 01:07:06.020
is going to end up so this one's yelling

01:07:06.150 01:07:08.420
at me it's blaring at me it is it's the

01:07:10.070 01:07:12.230
brand-new ambulance in the in the town

01:07:12.570 01:07:13.460
hall that they're showing off the

01:07:13.890 01:07:15.980
equipment on and I need to apply some

01:07:16.290 01:07:17.630
attention to this and get this done

01:07:18.360 01:07:19.970
never mind that I personally think it's

01:07:20.100 01:07:22.450
an absolutely lovely design and I am

01:07:23.460 01:07:25.250
looking forward to wearing it by I'm

01:07:25.710 01:07:25.940
excited by it

01:07:26.010 01:07:28.190
I like it and I'm curious to see what

01:07:28.470 01:07:31.540
other people think of it so overflow

01:07:32.550 01:07:36.560
moving on after project backs this is

01:07:39.960 01:07:42.830
so also in my have been on the needles

01:07:43.320 01:07:47.750
forever my darkhero socks I love this

01:07:48.600 01:07:50.810
I think this yarn is stunning this is

01:07:51.570 01:07:53.930
one of Shannon Shaw's yarns Shannon is

01:07:54.390 01:07:56.930
super natural yarns really beautiful

01:07:57.390 01:08:02.180
colors it is black sand and navies and

01:08:02.850 01:08:06.500
rusty Reds it's kind of like it some of

01:08:06.720 01:08:08.750
you may have memory of it's like dark

01:08:09.420 01:08:10.760
Superman it's like when Superman was

01:08:11.340 01:08:14.380
evil or something it does a beautiful

01:08:15.390 01:08:17.630
spiraling stripe up the leg

01:08:18.350 01:08:22.070
I initially cast these on trying to make

01:08:22.560 01:08:23.260
socks for my

01:08:23.750 01:08:26.620
husband in the leg of the sock because

01:08:26.930 01:08:29.559
he's got little skinny ankles I carried

01:08:29.810 01:08:32.680
an elastic thread and you can just

01:08:32.930 01:08:34.900
barely see it there it's an elastic

01:08:35.480 01:08:37.480
carry along to really give it some

01:08:38.420 01:08:41.200
stretch and rebound and it sucks right

01:08:41.420 01:08:44.320
back in as you can tell the the elastic

01:08:45.020 01:08:46.090
character that it adds to that is

01:08:48.319 01:08:50.530
sadly ultimately I get down through this

01:08:50.839 01:08:53.829
whole thing and discovered that what I

01:08:54.020 01:08:55.510
was trying to achieve for socks from my

01:08:55.910 01:08:59.410
husband this was not fulfilling he has a

01:09:00.290 01:09:01.930
really really big instep and this sock

01:09:02.240 01:09:05.680
is not accommodating that I did

01:09:05.900 01:09:07.329
ultimately finally knit him a pair of

01:09:07.670 01:09:09.340
socks they hit him wonderful I have his

01:09:09.859 01:09:12.099
formula finally but these were a failed

01:09:12.290 01:09:19.510
test and if I remember correctly they

01:09:19.580 01:09:22.000
were a failed test on him but they fit

01:09:22.549 01:09:26.079
me and my thought was I love the yarn

01:09:26.210 01:09:28.809
I love the yarn and I don't really want

01:09:28.970 01:09:31.780
to rip them out to knit him another pair

01:09:31.880 01:09:36.070
aside I wanted him to have this yarn but

01:09:36.140 01:09:37.599
I don't want to rip it all out to knit

01:09:37.730 01:09:40.059
it again I've got more than 3/4 of a

01:09:40.250 01:09:42.010
sock here so I thought I would just

01:09:42.529 01:09:46.210
finish knitting them for me but I

01:09:47.170 01:09:50.050
stopped so that I could attack the sock

01:09:50.660 01:09:52.450
problem from another angle and get him a

01:09:52.730 01:09:53.980
pair of socks because that was my goal I

01:09:54.290 01:09:56.230
wanted the knitting socks and you can

01:09:56.420 01:09:57.760
tell because I only have two double

01:09:58.130 01:09:59.950
pointed needles here and there are no

01:10:00.200 01:10:01.360
other double pointed needles in my

01:10:01.790 01:10:05.050
project back this yarn if you're loving

01:10:05.480 01:10:07.660
the colorway it's called they're

01:10:08.120 01:10:10.750
screwing with the wrong people and I

01:10:10.970 01:10:12.910
love you it's on her sprite sock base

01:10:13.190 01:10:14.500
it's a hundred percent superwash merino

01:10:15.380 01:10:17.260
four ply four hundred and thirty eight

01:10:17.660 01:10:20.410
yards over a hundred grams super natural

01:10:20.870 01:10:23.350
yarns you can find her on Etsy she is

01:10:25.760 01:10:27.460
she really was my mentor in starting

01:10:28.260 01:10:33.490
Bini a Shannon I love you so much I hope

01:10:34.500 01:10:37.070
everything good for you always and she

01:10:37.830 01:10:40.730
supports me we we have really I we have

01:10:40.770 01:10:43.460
a great relationship she is going to be

01:10:44.010 01:10:48.110
bending very soon I believe it's don't

01:10:48.570 01:10:49.670
remember the name of the show she's

01:10:50.100 01:10:51.050
defending out I want to say it's in

01:10:51.570 01:10:56.120
Kansas City but I don't hold me to that

01:10:56.280 01:10:59.360
I am delusional and she's actually made

01:10:59.610 01:11:01.940
of kids using some of my patterns with

01:11:02.130 01:11:04.190
my permission and I'm very excited and

01:11:04.230 01:11:09.280
very honored by that Shannon thank you I

01:11:10.290 01:11:11.690
love this yarn I need to finish these

01:11:12.060 01:11:13.670
socks I get sidetracked because I was

01:11:14.070 01:11:16.490
ahead a goal and I this wasn't meeting

01:11:16.710 01:11:19.180
the goal so I set it aside to reach goal

01:11:20.190 01:11:21.530
and I'm supposed to be knitting socks

01:11:21.810 01:11:23.420
for myself this year so I need to bump

01:11:23.640 01:11:26.000
these up in class so clearly they are

01:11:26.280 01:11:29.000
also in the fire and rescue part of my

01:11:29.370 01:11:31.430
parade where I need their blaring at me

01:11:31.470 01:11:37.040
I need to pay attention this one hurts

01:11:37.700 01:11:41.990
me this one hurts me I have a project

01:11:42.450 01:11:48.470
that I started three years ago

01:11:49.820 01:11:51.710
I think it's been three years

01:11:52.260 01:11:56.570
and I stopped because I made a error in

01:11:56.760 01:11:59.080
my stitch count I think I think I

01:12:00.090 01:12:01.400
suspected that I had an error in my

01:12:01.770 01:12:03.560
stitch count that I hadn't been paying

01:12:03.750 01:12:07.880
attention when I did one of the one of

01:12:08.010 01:12:12.560
the charts this is a design that was

01:12:13.110 01:12:17.740
inspired by a dear friend of mine and I

01:12:18.750 01:12:20.120
have great guilt over it because I

01:12:20.760 01:12:23.090
really wanted to finish this design it's

01:12:23.580 01:12:25.880
very much dedicated to my friend and

01:12:26.070 01:12:27.500
it's very important to me

01:12:28.080 01:12:29.570
it's inspired by her it's inspired by

01:12:29.970 01:12:33.140
our time together and I

01:12:33.210 01:12:35.149
they want to get it done it's another

01:12:35.400 01:12:37.250
one of these where I am going to have to

01:12:37.530 01:12:40.160
sit down and sort out where I am

01:12:40.440 01:12:41.990
if in fact there is an error there may

01:12:42.150 01:12:45.110
not even be an error and get on it I

01:12:45.780 01:12:49.100
don't need to get on it I'm saying three

01:12:49.409 01:12:54.050
years and now that I think of it it may

01:12:54.120 01:12:57.110
be more than that and maybe it's

01:12:57.630 01:13:02.180
probably four it's probably four it's

01:13:02.850 01:13:04.910
beautiful I'm excited by it I love it it

01:13:04.949 01:13:07.270
is a designer to design that I was

01:13:08.280 01:13:09.820
charting and knitting at the same time

01:13:10.830 01:13:15.320
and it uses a variety of lace stitches

01:13:15.810 01:13:20.350
that have been inspired by the

01:13:21.360 01:13:26.390
architectural features of old Santa Fe

01:13:27.360 01:13:32.300
Santa Fe is a very beautiful very it's a

01:13:32.489 01:13:35.810
very feminine City which is a strange

01:13:36.030 01:13:38.750
way to explain a city but there's

01:13:39.030 01:13:42.620
there's a very feminine air to it it's

01:13:42.840 01:13:48.410
very empowered and it's very lacy Hawk

01:13:48.630 01:13:51.080
how do you express the sea there's a lot

01:13:51.239 01:13:53.330
of wrought iron and of course there's

01:13:53.550 01:13:54.709
the turquoise from the beautiful

01:13:57.199 01:13:59.620
Southwest architecture and landscape and

01:14:00.630 01:14:02.899
it's all built on rolling hills and you

01:14:03.030 01:14:05.240
have little pockets and niches of

01:14:06.090 01:14:07.970
beautiful beautiful small communities

01:14:08.370 01:14:10.459
all drawn together it's also extremely

01:14:10.860 01:14:16.040
art heavy it is consistently rated the

01:14:16.800 01:14:18.560
worst-dressed city in America

01:14:18.960 01:14:23.209
and I think that is because of the

01:14:24.949 01:14:29.919
creativity and the boldness and the

01:14:31.219 01:14:33.740
fearless experimentation that happens

01:14:34.170 01:14:37.520
there it's people mix Styles very

01:14:37.949 01:14:39.500
quickly and without a lot of

01:14:40.440 01:14:42.320
consideration and there are I've seen

01:14:42.540 01:14:43.760
some outfits believe it

01:14:44.219 01:14:45.530
but I've also seen some really

01:14:46.230 01:14:47.600
interesting things that turn my head and

01:14:47.790 01:14:49.430
made me think differently about things

01:14:50.220 01:14:52.610
it can be a very inspiring city it's a

01:14:52.800 01:14:56.930
very inspiring community I'm very

01:14:57.240 01:15:00.350
fortunate that I live an hour away

01:15:00.630 01:15:03.920
I don't visit it often enough but my

01:15:04.170 01:15:06.260
friend and I used to visit it and we'd

01:15:06.450 01:15:06.890
go up

01:15:07.080 01:15:08.600
we were ladies that lunch stand shopped

01:15:08.970 01:15:10.580
and there were a couple different yarn

01:15:10.950 01:15:12.050
stores out there that are no longer

01:15:12.780 01:15:15.980
there the death of your local yarn shops

01:15:16.440 01:15:20.330
really is just desperately saddening but

01:15:20.490 01:15:22.880
in our adventures up there and looking

01:15:23.010 01:15:25.250
at the architecture and the gardens and

01:15:25.560 01:15:28.490
shopping and everything this was

01:15:28.800 01:15:30.710
inspired I'm gonna bend to grab it it's

01:15:30.900 01:15:35.750
far away oh the Duchess of Santa Fe

01:15:36.300 01:15:39.350
because it is in this beautiful gold

01:15:39.990 01:15:42.860
color and it really has all these laces

01:15:43.230 01:15:45.080
that are inspired like I said by the

01:15:45.930 01:15:48.710
architecture and it uses a horizontal

01:15:49.200 01:15:53.440
braid stitch to divide them very much

01:15:54.450 01:15:56.060
representative of the tile that you see

01:15:56.520 01:15:59.210
everywhere and I love it it's designed

01:15:59.520 01:16:01.730
it's it needs to block but it's not even

01:16:01.890 01:16:09.340
done it's going to be a big biased wrap

01:16:10.350 01:16:14.690
this is the beginning of it and it

01:16:15.660 01:16:18.350
advances and those sections each get

01:16:19.170 01:16:20.900
longer across because it's all biased

01:16:21.450 01:16:25.400
and then eventually it turns the corner

01:16:25.710 01:16:27.410
and starts to bias in the other

01:16:27.630 01:16:33.560
direction so you start out with very few

01:16:34.080 01:16:41.980
stitches and you build in a triangle out

01:16:42.990 01:16:45.940
to the turning point before you start to

01:16:46.950 01:16:49.040
increase and decrease at matching rates

01:16:50.040 01:16:52.390
to angle off so that the section is

01:16:53.400 01:16:54.709
straight but angle

01:16:55.440 01:16:57.470
does that make sense the stitches are

01:16:57.930 01:16:59.060
angled but the section actually

01:16:59.610 01:17:01.939
progresses straight it's beautiful I

01:17:02.640 01:17:04.340
love it I have an on waste yarn as you

01:17:04.500 01:17:06.439
can tell I farmed it for the needle and

01:17:06.540 01:17:08.120
I put it on waste yarn because I was

01:17:08.580 01:17:10.729
concerned about the stitch now what was

01:17:11.420 01:17:15.200
happening it is multiple skeins of

01:17:15.600 01:17:17.930
fingering weight yarn again this is a

01:17:18.660 01:17:21.220
Shannon Shaw supernatural wools

01:17:22.230 01:17:23.360
supernatural yarns I keep saying her

01:17:23.550 01:17:28.189
name wrong colorway this particular yarn

01:17:28.469 01:17:31.100
is called Belle Beauty and the Beast

01:17:32.100 01:17:36.040
it's this gorgeous gold I just love it

01:17:37.050 01:17:39.500
it's on her nips off its 80% superwash

01:17:39.560 01:17:44.180
merino 20% nylon 120 yards 30 grams I

01:17:44.370 01:17:46.370
think that's the the wrong tag for this

01:17:46.620 01:17:49.689
you would have this 100 Graeme garden

01:17:50.699 01:17:53.870
let me double check her note here now

01:17:54.030 01:17:55.400
that's what she labeled it with I think

01:17:55.590 01:17:56.930
she was just getting the knockout and

01:17:57.060 01:18:02.320
used her mini 30 grand mini label for me

01:18:03.330 01:18:05.600
because I had ordered two skeins and I

01:18:06.000 01:18:06.979
realized two skins were not gonna be

01:18:07.199 01:18:08.300
enough for this project and that I

01:18:08.880 01:18:11.750
ultimately needed at least four and it

01:18:11.880 01:18:13.670
is a hand dyed so I am alternating back

01:18:13.710 01:18:15.280
and forth so you don't get a big line

01:18:16.290 01:18:17.300
indicating that it was a different pop

01:18:18.380 01:18:20.900
batch it's beautiful I love it it's

01:18:21.570 01:18:23.450
difficult to see because it does need to

01:18:23.610 01:18:26.900
be blocked I'm not sure how well it's

01:18:27.120 01:18:29.510
going to hold its block because the

01:18:30.060 01:18:31.790
stitches are very elastic and I've used

01:18:33.080 01:18:37.220
a super wash with nylon which is more

01:18:37.440 01:18:39.140
likely to rebound to his natural state

01:18:39.570 01:18:42.170
than a whole wool that I can block the

01:18:42.510 01:18:44.350
Bejing keys out of it it will stay

01:18:45.360 01:18:46.760
progressive blocking does wonders you

01:18:46.949 01:18:48.110
never know it could work

01:18:48.870 01:18:51.590
like I said somewhere in here when you

01:18:52.080 01:18:57.860
do the horizontal banding you I'm trying

01:18:58.020 01:18:59.780
to increase on one side and decrease on

01:18:59.910 01:19:02.240
the other and it naturally does that and

01:19:02.400 01:19:02.690
I'm a

01:19:02.850 01:19:05.420
made a mistake at some point in that

01:19:06.300 01:19:08.300
stitching and I think my stitch count

01:19:08.550 01:19:10.400
came off and I think I figured it out in

01:19:11.070 01:19:15.440
the next row of lace I I need to sit

01:19:15.480 01:19:17.450
down and I need to research my project

01:19:17.580 01:19:19.130
and I need to figure it out and I have

01:19:19.170 01:19:21.260
the pattern and the charts all worked

01:19:21.480 01:19:23.990
out so that I know the order of each of

01:19:24.120 01:19:26.000
the laces and what each of the laces

01:19:26.340 01:19:28.700
meant to me it's getting back to that

01:19:29.220 01:19:30.470
point to look at it again and sort

01:19:30.660 01:19:33.320
myself out so I can do it I love this

01:19:33.900 01:19:36.380
project I want to finish this project it

01:19:36.660 01:19:39.350
makes me happy and at the same time it's

01:19:40.200 01:19:42.280
crushing me that I have not touched this

01:19:43.290 01:19:51.710
in so long huh I love it it's gonna be

01:19:52.200 01:19:56.240
glorious if I would just do it what is

01:19:56.460 01:20:02.390
it with us that we have such brilliant

01:20:02.580 01:20:06.740
big dreams and sometimes we let our

01:20:07.080 01:20:09.590
dreams drift away we shouldn't do that

01:20:09.810 01:20:11.510
we shouldn't do that we hold on to your

01:20:11.730 01:20:13.310
dreams hold on to your dreams chase your

01:20:13.500 01:20:14.480
dreams finish your drink I'm gonna

01:20:14.700 01:20:20.860
finish my dreams alright then ha ha hmm

01:20:21.870 01:20:23.840
it's a good thing I made a list then at

01:20:24.120 01:20:25.760
the end of every parade you have that

01:20:26.100 01:20:27.950
funny group of stragglers that you're

01:20:28.440 01:20:29.990
not really sure we're part of the parade

01:20:30.240 01:20:33.260
at all and you've already got that from

01:20:33.900 01:20:35.180
fire rescue gone through showing off

01:20:35.400 01:20:37.580
their equipment and you're like that's

01:20:37.800 01:20:40.070
this disbanded group here that's kind of

01:20:40.350 01:20:41.870
following it as a part of the parade are

01:20:42.180 01:20:44.650
they drunk onlookers staggering behind

01:20:45.660 01:20:47.630
minor drunk onlookers staggering behind

01:20:48.000 01:20:53.030
I have a copy of my ship's a short shawl

01:20:53.340 01:20:55.550
that I was working on fingering weight

01:20:56.400 01:20:58.100
that was a yarn that I had hand dyed

01:20:58.740 01:21:03.620
myself I can't even find it I tore my

01:21:04.050 01:21:05.780
studio apart relatively quickly this

01:21:06.270 01:21:08.630
morning looking for where it is I went

01:21:08.820 01:21:09.710
through all the project bags and

01:21:10.350 01:21:13.370
so I've dug everything out I can see it

01:21:13.470 01:21:14.750
in my head I remember what it was in

01:21:14.970 01:21:17.600
last I can not locate it I even remember

01:21:17.760 01:21:20.810
what needles it was on it's here

01:21:21.150 01:21:22.460
somewhere I need to find it I need to

01:21:22.860 01:21:25.990
finish it it's in a beautiful grass

01:21:27.000 01:21:29.000
colorway mixes of greens it's very

01:21:29.400 01:21:31.700
pretty I would like to finish it I don't

01:21:32.010 01:21:34.430
know why I have given it up I don't know

01:21:34.470 01:21:34.760
I do

01:21:34.950 01:21:36.680
I had to harvest needles from it for

01:21:36.840 01:21:37.790
something else that I wanted to finish

01:21:38.360 01:21:40.400
and therefore it's at and I haven't put

01:21:40.500 01:21:43.100
the needle back in it and finished it I

01:21:43.560 01:21:44.390
have a hat

01:21:44.460 01:21:47.210
it is my Brenda hat if you look at my

01:21:47.730 01:21:49.610
patterns it's my Brenda design

01:21:50.450 01:21:53.900
I was remitting it just to have another

01:21:54.450 01:21:57.080
one of them available and not find it I

01:21:57.150 01:21:59.930
know it's here somewhere I'm most

01:22:00.150 01:22:02.480
disappointed in myself that I apparently

01:22:03.060 01:22:07.520
have some whips that are I don't know

01:22:07.860 01:22:09.830
where they are and I'm terrified I'm

01:22:09.930 01:22:11.690
terrified because whips have a tendency

01:22:13.100 01:22:15.440
to breed or replicate or something

01:22:15.960 01:22:17.990
multiply and when I do finally find

01:22:18.300 01:22:20.510
these two projects they're maybe six or

01:22:20.580 01:22:21.950
seven other projects with them and that

01:22:22.320 01:22:23.810
just scares me half to death because my

01:22:24.180 01:22:28.040
list is plenty long enough at the very

01:22:28.500 01:22:31.070
tail end at the very tail end I do have

01:22:31.860 01:22:37.220
one of said ashamed projects that I was

01:22:37.500 01:22:41.560
able to find which kind of bums me out

01:22:42.710 01:22:45.080
my I told you I'm a cold person I'm

01:22:45.150 01:22:48.260
always frozen and I forever have cold

01:22:48.570 01:22:51.650
hands in the car driving in the morning

01:22:51.840 01:22:54.440
my hands are frozen and my husband sits

01:22:54.660 01:22:58.220
there with that I'm a man and I'm

01:22:58.500 01:23:00.680
brilliant and I know it look on his face

01:23:01.680 01:23:03.050
where he's going to say something that

01:23:03.350 01:23:07.070
is bleeding obvious and pointed out and

01:23:07.260 01:23:09.800
kind of shame me for my stupidity it's

01:23:10.020 01:23:12.950
not malice it's not balance but he just

01:23:13.200 01:23:14.510
looks at me when I'm going to oh my god

01:23:14.700 01:23:18.020
my hands are so cold it goes don't you

01:23:19.610 01:23:22.400
knit don't you have an entire room full

01:23:22.470 01:23:23.279
of wool

01:23:24.130 01:23:25.799
why don't you make yourself some mittens

01:23:25.989 01:23:27.180
why don't you make yourself some gloves

01:23:28.150 01:23:29.759
yeah you could do this for yourself man

01:23:29.889 01:23:31.549
your hands wouldn't be so cold

01:23:32.579 01:23:37.200
yes darling I know I can't stand making

01:23:37.630 01:23:40.649
mittens I can't stand making gloves I

01:23:41.530 01:23:44.549
don't know why I don't mind making a

01:23:45.519 01:23:47.609
fingerless glove but for this intents

01:23:47.739 01:23:51.149
and purposes it's not gonna work the the

01:23:51.760 01:23:54.180
intent is to warm my fingers and that

01:23:54.429 01:23:57.089
means either gloves or mittens and so I

01:23:57.340 01:24:01.620
had pulled out a sock yarn that I had

01:24:01.809 01:24:02.910
bought a hundred years ago

01:24:03.400 01:24:09.689
it's Paton's Kroy socks FX it is a what

01:24:09.849 01:24:11.669
they call a washable wool will call that

01:24:12.039 01:24:14.939
super wash and 25% nylon it is a

01:24:15.610 01:24:18.240
commercially produced it's in a 50 I've

01:24:18.429 01:24:21.120
got a couple of these and it's a kind of

01:24:21.250 01:24:27.180
a gradient barber pole that I have on

01:24:27.460 01:24:29.970
hand and therefore I should use and make

01:24:30.570 01:24:32.879
myself gloves because there's a small

01:24:33.599 01:24:36.060
undertaking this would be my progress on

01:24:36.309 01:24:43.500
say glove I have the temporary the

01:24:43.989 01:24:47.790
holding line in here for the thumb and I

01:24:47.949 01:24:51.660
have a pinky that is most most of

01:24:52.389 01:24:54.240
ointment I need I think I'm at the point

01:24:54.429 01:24:55.709
where I needed to figure out the length

01:24:55.989 01:25:02.899
and then decreases that's where I'm at I

01:25:03.909 01:25:05.580
have guilt about this because I really

01:25:05.920 01:25:07.649
could use these and when they're done

01:25:08.050 01:25:09.209
I'm going to appreciate them I gave

01:25:09.429 01:25:11.640
myself a nice long wrestle tuck up under

01:25:11.769 01:25:18.200
my jacket the size is pretty good for me

01:25:19.530 01:25:23.520
I don't know that I was following actual

01:25:24.010 01:25:25.080
instruction there's no there's no

01:25:25.360 01:25:26.790
pattern in the bag there's just the yarn

01:25:27.099 01:25:30.660
and the octopus of needles where I own a

01:25:30.940 01:25:34.110
lot of needles they're everywhere

01:25:35.120 01:25:37.210
it's one of those I must be following a

01:25:37.730 01:25:40.000
pattern it might be Marley Birds pattern

01:25:40.340 01:25:42.700
from craftsy from her knit her mitts and

01:25:42.980 01:25:47.860
gloves class because it does the like

01:25:48.140 01:25:52.720
thumb on the front thing which I'm

01:25:53.600 01:25:55.300
questioning the placement of as I have

01:25:55.400 01:25:57.100
it on my hand with my pinky finger in

01:25:57.830 01:25:59.020
that I'm not sure how that's going to

01:25:59.210 01:26:00.670
work because my thumb doesn't come out

01:26:00.800 01:26:09.910
of the front of my hand I'm not not

01:26:10.490 01:26:14.020
thrilled with this I could readily tear

01:26:14.300 01:26:17.830
back down and simplify my life and make

01:26:17.870 01:26:22.630
a mitten or I could continue with this

01:26:22.900 01:26:25.660
and learn from it and find out if having

01:26:25.940 01:26:30.370
the thumb come out at the bone here from

01:26:30.530 01:26:32.860
the front of a glove actually does

01:26:33.560 01:26:35.620
articulate over and work that's a lot of

01:26:35.900 01:26:37.630
work to figure that out I could jump and

01:26:37.790 01:26:39.610
just do the thumb right now and test

01:26:40.090 01:26:43.630
that I need to find the pattern that I

01:26:43.850 01:26:46.360
was using I need to figure out what

01:26:47.000 01:26:48.610
instruction I was used I had no idea

01:26:48.890 01:26:50.680
what that is that has gone holy by the

01:26:51.550 01:26:57.490
wayside I need it it's logical it makes

01:26:57.890 01:27:01.420
sense am i I'm not thrilled I'm not

01:27:01.760 01:27:03.160
thrilled like I said it's the drunk

01:27:03.710 01:27:05.200
straggler at the end of the parade that

01:27:06.050 01:27:07.330
you're not sure was actually meant to be

01:27:07.490 01:27:11.350
in the parade so I need to make some

01:27:11.390 01:27:14.200
hard decisions about this and ultimately

01:27:14.480 01:27:15.730
I could rip the whole thing back where

01:27:15.830 01:27:17.380
you wind up that ball and make something

01:27:17.660 01:27:20.110
else with it and be very happy I also

01:27:20.630 01:27:24.490
kind of are arguing with myself

01:27:25.010 01:27:27.210
obviously you can see the argument where

01:27:28.220 01:27:29.890
I'd like the two each of my fingering

01:27:30.020 01:27:33.040
weight for a mid-air glove but I'm not

01:27:33.440 01:27:34.770
thrilled with the amount of time

01:27:35.440 01:27:37.140
because I don't like making mittens a

01:27:37.630 01:27:43.650
glove so I'm kind of not I'm not feeling

01:27:43.750 01:27:48.440
it I'm not feeling that that concludes I

01:27:49.450 01:27:51.180
have a needle oh it was for that I do

01:27:52.230 01:27:54.120
okay don't you hate that when you look

01:27:54.310 01:27:56.490
down and there's spare parts like what

01:27:56.590 01:28:00.660
does that go to that concludes the

01:28:00.940 01:28:02.910
parade that that concludes the parade

01:28:03.220 01:28:05.370
and quite the parade it has been I'm

01:28:05.920 01:28:08.460
looking at the counter on my camera and

01:28:08.620 01:28:10.830
I'm like they're gonna have to break

01:28:11.020 01:28:12.390
this up in part two they're gonna have a

01:28:13.030 01:28:15.900
marathon ahead of them and I questioned

01:28:16.390 01:28:19.230
the smarts behind that so I'm gonna come

01:28:19.420 01:28:21.030
back around to the designer lon I talked

01:28:21.130 01:28:22.140
about it briefly when I was talking

01:28:22.180 01:28:24.750
about the farmhouse shawl as I on the

01:28:24.970 01:28:26.850
fly here kind of dedicated myself and

01:28:26.950 01:28:28.320
made the decision that I'm going to work

01:28:28.510 01:28:32.400
on that as my design along and I really

01:28:32.560 01:28:34.140
want to get that done and I need to

01:28:34.930 01:28:36.480
flush aside all the shiny things and

01:28:36.670 01:28:39.810
really finish that the design along is

01:28:40.210 01:28:42.080
open to all of you we did pick a theme

01:28:43.090 01:28:45.240
connection and that's just a jumping-off

01:28:46.270 01:28:48.180
that's your inspiration you can pick

01:28:48.340 01:28:49.560
your own path you do what you want

01:28:49.720 01:28:52.590
you're the designer feel free to post

01:28:53.260 01:28:55.080
images in the voting thread that you

01:28:55.360 01:28:57.930
feel inspired connection there is a

01:28:58.300 01:29:00.150
thread for chattering questions as well

01:29:00.190 01:29:03.060
as progress come join the conversation

01:29:03.280 01:29:05.880
and talk to us about your how your brain

01:29:05.920 01:29:08.160
works how you designed look at how other

01:29:08.650 01:29:10.820
people do

01:29:11.830 01:29:15.060
let's converse let's talk and let's see

01:29:15.400 01:29:17.640
if there are ways that we can improve

01:29:17.950 01:29:20.190
our flow or if there's a different way

01:29:20.260 01:29:23.040
to think about things or problem-solve

01:29:23.230 01:29:25.440
if you're stuck on something throw it on

01:29:25.570 01:29:26.760
the table and let's see what other

01:29:27.130 01:29:30.810
people think there will be a thread for

01:29:31.300 01:29:33.270
finished objects where you will post a

01:29:33.490 01:29:35.550
picture of your completed object for

01:29:35.860 01:29:39.000
your entry and there will be a prize I

01:29:39.250 01:29:41.070
have not figured out if it's one or

01:29:41.830 01:29:43.620
multiple prizes and I haven't figured

01:29:43.750 01:29:46.919
if we're going to vote or we're gonna

01:29:47.050 01:29:49.080
get multiple categories or if we're

01:29:49.179 01:29:51.359
gonna do a random we'll worry about that

01:29:51.460 01:29:52.649

desperately you should see really when I

01:30:37.270 01:30:39.050
was digging through all of my whips

01:30:40.060 01:30:42.629
there's a section in my personals that I

01:30:42.909 01:30:44.939
have two closets and one is my personal

01:30:45.250 01:30:48.780
stash and one is my stock for my shop

01:30:49.290 01:30:51.479
and I had to dig through my personal

01:30:52.030 01:30:53.609
stash because there's a section in there

01:30:53.949 01:30:56.669
where I put some of my whips and I kept

01:30:56.860 01:30:58.200
pulling yarn out and going oh that's

01:30:58.449 01:30:59.790

01:31:16.449 01:31:22.200
remarkable gem this is the love from

01:31:22.900 01:31:27.470
Lisa colorway by Cappy at the yarn and I

01:31:28.480 01:31:30.569
Cappy is a talented designer this yarn

01:31:30.880 01:31:32.189
is gorgeous it is a hundred percent

01:31:33.010 01:31:34.770
superwash merino four hundred and ninety

01:31:34.960 01:31:38.939
yards over a hundred grams I just love

01:31:39.130 01:31:41.010
these colors and I'm looking at this

01:31:41.320 01:31:43.200
yellow this beautiful mustard and I'm

01:31:43.719 01:31:46.500
thinking again about that wrap that I'm

01:31:46.869 01:31:48.030
designing and I'm like well that would

01:31:48.310 01:31:51.899
coordinate beautifully because you have

01:31:52.000 01:31:53.160
to worry about what socks you're going

01:31:53.290 01:31:56.510
to knit to wear with your wrap

01:31:57.210 01:31:58.729

01:32:32.309 01:32:35.120
this I have that cup of tea ready and I

01:32:35.190 01:32:36.350
will have that connection I'll be

01:32:36.750 01:32:38.180
thinking about her in a tangible way

01:32:38.790 01:32:40.580
while I cast on this project and I sip

01:32:40.710 01:32:44.060
on that tea further she very very very

01:32:44.909 01:32:48.530

her saying that the handsome elephants

01:33:56.639 01:33:58.399

wonderfully generous I have not decided

01:34:09.830 01:34:12.850
which I want to keep I'm definitely

01:34:13.510 01:34:15.520

sorry my battery warning just came up

they make me happy as for the other two

01:34:26.810 01:34:28.840
I can't decide I can't decide so when we

01:34:29.000 01:34:30.400
get closer to the giveaway I'll sort it

01:34:30.530 01:34:32.650
out at that point I am getting a battery

01:34:32.870 01:34:34.240
warning because I have prattled on

01:34:34.670 01:34:36.370
forever it is still ticking up so we're

01:34:36.440 01:34:38.770
gonna call it good we're not gonna call

01:34:38.810 01:34:39.790
it good I'm gonna plug it in we're gonna

01:34:40.040 01:34:41.800
keep going because I have something else

01:34:42.290 01:34:43.870
important that I do want to present you

01:34:44.090 01:34:46.000
guys it's an idea that I had and I'm

01:34:46.460 01:34:47.919
really excited about it I want to see

01:34:48.140 01:34:49.510
what your feedback is on it what'd you

01:34:49.790 01:34:58.240
think of it um I do my podcast like I

01:34:58.520 01:35:01.360
said earlier in the podcast for my sense

01:35:01.489 01:35:04.840
of knit community for my my neck loop

01:35:05.270 01:35:08.979
because I don't have one and I suspect

01:35:09.110 01:35:11.830
that a lot of you watch my podcast

01:35:12.250 01:35:14.140
because we have similar interests

01:35:14.480 01:35:19.200
obviously we have similar personalities

01:35:20.210 01:35:22.060
we we have something in common already

01:35:23.410 01:35:25.930
and if you have something in common with

01:35:26.090 01:35:28.090
me you're very likely to have something

01:35:28.190 01:35:30.220
in common with all of the other viewers

01:35:30.610 01:35:34.060
and I wanted to do something that kind

01:35:34.190 01:35:37.450
of knit our little community together a

01:35:37.760 01:35:39.520
little bit more closely and I had kind

01:35:39.620 01:35:41.860
of a radical idea about it I was

01:35:42.290 01:35:46.500
thinking about kind of a knit together

01:35:47.510 01:35:50.470
pen pal kind of a program sort of thing

01:35:53.590 01:35:56.860
where if you wish if this is of interest

01:35:57.020 01:35:59.410
to you we would have an initial sign up

01:35:59.660 01:36:02.010
so that I could get a head count and

01:36:03.020 01:36:04.750
with that sign up and with that head

01:36:05.239 01:36:09.370
I would then dye up a bunch of yarns but

01:36:09.410 01:36:12.580
I would only dye them up in pot mates in

01:36:12.920 01:36:15.550
sets of two so that for each colorway

01:36:15.800 01:36:18.160
they were only going to be two skeins in

01:36:18.650 01:36:21.640
that I would then open it up for you

01:36:21.830 01:36:22.570
each to go

01:36:22.670 01:36:25.300
and purchase the yarn that you were most

01:36:25.550 01:36:27.250
attracted to you go and you buy your

01:36:28.690 01:36:32.800
skin whoever buys your pot mate whoever

01:36:33.080 01:36:35.890
buys the matching skein would then be

01:36:36.470 01:36:40.090
your knit mate and determined on what

01:36:40.550 01:36:42.790
the interest is and how secure you guys

01:36:43.070 01:36:46.750
all feel I would then provide each of

01:36:47.180 01:36:50.710
you the other person's email or Ravelry

01:36:50.900 01:36:54.010
ID whichever whatever we agreed on and

01:36:54.410 01:36:56.940
this would give you a jumping-off point

01:36:57.950 01:37:00.190
where you can meet another like-mind

01:37:00.580 01:37:02.560
knitter where you already have something

01:37:02.690 01:37:04.240
in common you have the same skein of

01:37:04.400 01:37:07.900
yarn you have you've purchased something

01:37:08.030 01:37:10.090
that you love and that gives you an

01:37:10.580 01:37:12.670
opening about something to discuss what

01:37:13.310 01:37:14.350
patterning in it with it why did you

01:37:14.690 01:37:18.040
choose that yarn and an introduction a

01:37:18.560 01:37:20.530
soft introduction to each other so that

01:37:21.050 01:37:23.950
you've got a knit mate and in knitting

01:37:24.530 01:37:26.470
penpal as it were and you have the

01:37:27.020 01:37:29.070
opportunity to meet somebody else online

01:37:30.080 01:37:32.220
do you have something in common with

01:37:33.230 01:37:35.860
it's kind of a radical idea it it kind

01:37:35.960 01:37:39.100
of excites me the idea that I would go

01:37:39.320 01:37:41.860
and I would pick out a yarn and meet

01:37:42.140 01:37:44.890
somebody new and then we have the option

01:37:45.910 01:37:48.400
of maybe picking out the same pattern

01:37:49.360 01:37:52.470
and knitting along together with it or

01:37:53.480 01:37:55.030
choosing patterns that complement each

01:37:55.340 01:37:59.560
other such as we're both doing a two

01:37:59.750 01:38:02.020
color fade cowl and we're going to see

01:38:02.720 01:38:05.470
how different the yarn looks where we

01:38:05.720 01:38:07.000
combine a different yarn with it or we

01:38:07.130 01:38:09.190
do a striping project or something and

01:38:09.260 01:38:10.450
we get to really appreciate that yarn

01:38:10.640 01:38:12.040
and converse about the yarn and our

01:38:12.380 01:38:13.660
knitting and our projects and whether or

01:38:13.760 01:38:15.480
not we're working together on something

01:38:16.510 01:38:20.850
and this could ultimately go so far as

01:38:21.860 01:38:23.590
when we're all done we may we may have

01:38:23.870 01:38:26.380
like an outside deadline three four

01:38:26.780 01:38:28.060
months give you plenty of time to work

01:38:28.190 01:38:30.130
on projects I have a bazillion the

01:38:30.710 01:38:32.320
projects that I need to work on so

01:38:33.230 01:38:34.110
stopping everything to do

01:38:34.240 01:38:35.670
the project can be difficult and I get

01:38:35.860 01:38:37.970
that and having open timelines is good

01:38:38.980 01:38:41.100
but having an opportunity where each

01:38:41.800 01:38:45.270
team can post what they did with their

01:38:45.910 01:38:47.760
yarns and maybe we do some kind of a

01:38:48.130 01:38:49.740
giveaway kind of drawing based on that

01:38:50.250 01:38:53.550
even but beyond giveaways in yarn and

01:38:53.620 01:38:55.350
all that it would be an opportunity to

01:38:55.540 01:38:58.050
meet somebody else and there's not a

01:38:58.570 01:39:00.480
huge cost associated to that you're

01:39:00.670 01:39:02.270
buying a skein of yarn that you love

01:39:03.280 01:39:04.920
there's your cost outside of that

01:39:05.470 01:39:06.810
there's the cost of time of emailing

01:39:07.210 01:39:09.150
back and forth with somebody that you

01:39:09.430 01:39:13.800
may be the next best friend if this is

01:39:13.930 01:39:14.700
of interest to you

01:39:14.740 01:39:17.520
I did lob this out in my group on

01:39:18.250 01:39:20.750
Ravelry if you're not on Ravelry that's

01:39:21.760 01:39:23.580
behind I get it not everybody uses every

01:39:24.070 01:39:25.890
platform out there you are welcome to

01:39:26.260 01:39:28.500
message me directly via email or right

01:39:28.870 01:39:32.370
here on the YouTube platform let me know

01:39:32.770 01:39:34.380
if this is of interest to you if you

01:39:34.420 01:39:36.090
think that that's a cool idea if you

01:39:36.250 01:39:38.880
would participate and what your concerns

01:39:39.220 01:39:41.070
are do you have privacy concerns about

01:39:41.560 01:39:43.590
that do you have expense concerns about

01:39:43.870 01:39:47.400
that I have played with that in my head

01:39:47.650 01:39:49.470
I really have thought about this a lot

01:39:49.690 01:39:53.430
before I love a target you where there

01:39:53.560 01:39:55.920
would be the question of do we all want

01:39:56.020 01:39:58.380
to do this on a worsted weight do we all

01:39:58.660 01:40:00.750
want to do this on a fingering weight if

01:40:01.360 01:40:03.840
this is a set group like this absolutely

01:40:04.030 01:40:05.490
I'm going to offer that at a discounted

01:40:07.320 01:40:09.900
rate because I recognize that there's

01:40:10.510 01:40:13.080
expense people not everybody can go out

01:40:13.360 01:40:16.890
and buy 20 skeins of yarn at the crafts

01:40:17.290 01:40:18.900
fair and then go home and order online

01:40:19.570 01:40:21.510
and then order from this indeed ion that

01:40:21.820 01:40:23.130
Andy Dyer and this one's got a club and

01:40:23.650 01:40:26.160
I get it I have a tight budget myself my

01:40:26.830 01:40:28.170
god I just got an estimate of things

01:40:28.360 01:40:35.250
that need to be done to my car isn't it

01:40:35.410 01:40:37.020
amazing how repairs there like

01:40:37.840 01:40:39.090
one-twentieth the cost of a new car

01:40:39.670 01:40:44.340
sometimes or or worse a tenth I'm going

01:40:44.970 01:40:45.980
a little sticker shock that's neither

01:40:46.110 01:40:48.140
here nor there but it's me relating to

01:40:48.240 01:40:49.220
you and understanding that you have

01:40:49.860 01:40:51.620
expenses in your life I got a hot water

01:40:51.750 01:40:53.180
heater there's laughing at me because

01:40:53.550 01:40:56.240
it's just waiting waiting for the

01:40:56.970 01:40:59.540
coldest morning that I sleep in before

01:40:59.730 01:41:00.920
it laughs and go say I don't work

01:41:01.230 01:41:03.680
anymore but it's coming I know it and

01:41:03.870 01:41:06.110
I'm terrified of it and we need to clean

01:41:06.300 01:41:08.620
that garage and be proactive yeah anyway

01:41:09.630 01:41:12.260
we're all real we all have lives and we

01:41:12.390 01:41:14.030
all have expenses and I don't want this

01:41:14.280 01:41:17.300
to be a deficit I don't want it to be

01:41:17.640 01:41:19.250
something you miss out on I'm trying to

01:41:19.440 01:41:22.010
build the community and give you a gift

01:41:22.740 01:41:24.740
so please I I would love to hear what

01:41:24.840 01:41:26.870
you think of about the knit together

01:41:27.810 01:41:29.810
community mixer kind of a thing that I'm

01:41:30.090 01:41:33.350
going to buy I'm lobbying out there very

01:41:33.450 01:41:36.530
very finely here I'm just going to cover

01:41:36.840 01:41:40.160

the next podcast it will be May 5th

01:42:07.530 01:42:10.220
there is exclusive content available if

01:42:10.380 01:42:12.860
you are a patreon member and that

01:42:13.260 01:42:14.510
includes patterns and worksheets and

01:42:14.730 01:42:16.280
more there's there's always going to be

01:42:16.770 01:42:19.070
something there I try to add to it on a

01:42:19.470 01:42:22.430
regular basis often it is patterns that

01:42:22.500 01:42:25.880
I am designing and I design as quickly

01:42:26.100 01:42:28.030
as I can

01:42:29.040 01:42:33.020
you've seen the work look but the

01:42:33.390 01:42:36.170
ultimate goal of my patreon is to fund

01:42:36.900 01:42:39.080
things such as full-length online

01:42:41.540 01:42:44.030
classes there was recently discussion

01:42:44.370 01:42:46.640
about trying to do a virtual midnight

01:42:47.340 01:42:48.800
where we are able to sit down with our

01:42:49.410 01:42:52.850
our phones or our laptops and log in to

01:42:52.890 01:42:54.350
a video like

01:42:54.900 01:42:57.590
conference call and for those people who

01:42:57.719 01:42:59.600
are remote or those people that don't

01:42:59.760 01:43:02.209
have knit groups we would all be able to

01:43:02.580 01:43:04.250
connect and see each other face to face

01:43:04.980 01:43:06.649
voice to voice with our projects in our

01:43:06.929 01:43:09.439
laps in our tea in our hands and have a

01:43:09.810 01:43:13.580
community knit initially I've looked at

01:43:13.710 01:43:14.840
this it looks like that there is cost

01:43:15.210 01:43:16.609
involved in that and through patreon

01:43:16.650 01:43:18.830
I would fund that and make that happen

01:43:19.050 01:43:20.899
for all of us it's just a matter of

01:43:21.090 01:43:22.430
getting that funding built up so that

01:43:22.619 01:43:24.160
that's something that we can do and

01:43:25.170 01:43:26.629
researching that option if you have

01:43:27.360 01:43:29.169
knowledge about how those things work I

01:43:30.179 01:43:31.910
would love to hear from you I'm a little

01:43:32.489 01:43:34.580
technic technically declined on those I

01:43:34.889 01:43:37.490
haven't done them my understanding is

01:43:37.530 01:43:39.709
that Google does kind of a nit night

01:43:40.050 01:43:42.590
thing or connect a video Connect group

01:43:42.989 01:43:45.830
thing but I I'm pretty sure there's cost

01:43:46.230 01:43:47.419
involved in that and I need to get a

01:43:47.760 01:43:49.040
heads up as to what that cost is so I

01:43:49.199 01:43:50.840
can budget that into the funding that I

01:43:51.150 01:43:54.379
receive I would love to hear from you

01:43:55.340 01:43:58.340
that's everything I have prattled on for

01:43:58.440 01:44:01.340
a very long time I'm sure that you've

01:44:01.530 01:44:03.439
had to watch this in little breakups or

01:44:03.630 01:44:05.270
you sat down and had a find it with me

01:44:05.639 01:44:12.290
and I'm so glad you joined me every time

01:44:12.330 01:44:15.830
I sit down with you this is a

01:44:16.800 01:44:19.490
conversation to you collectively but

01:44:19.800 01:44:23.000
also very much to you the individual you

private time this is our self time and

01:44:28.770 01:44:31.459

01:44:31.949 01:44:36.050
meaningful to you as well so thank you I

01:44:36.570 01:44:37.879
