hi I'm Robert Cochran welcome back to

00:00:06.060 00:00:07.909
faces of Parkinson's today I'm joined by

00:00:08.550 00:00:10.009
Christian band a friend of mine in Las

00:00:10.230 00:00:12.200
Vegas Christian how are you I'm doing

00:00:12.420 00:00:13.940
well and yourself I'm doing really well

00:00:14.070 00:00:17.210
thank you so Christian you to get this

00:00:17.430 00:00:19.790
out quickly or diagnosed in 2014 I

00:00:20.460 00:00:21.800
understand which was when you were 34

00:00:22.080 00:00:25.429
years old and you are a father of two

00:00:25.470 00:00:28.339
kids right that is correct that is a lot

00:00:28.590 00:00:30.259
to have on your plate can you take me

00:00:30.300 00:00:33.020
back to 2014 what that felt like with

00:00:33.300 00:00:34.940
kids who is practical newborn at that

00:00:35.309 00:00:37.340
time another very young one and getting

00:00:37.530 00:00:39.139
this diagnosis and tell me what you went

00:00:41.190 00:00:44.810
upon my initial diagnosis it was it came

00:00:45.000 00:00:46.639
as a shock I didn't know much about

00:00:47.219 00:00:49.160
Parkinson's all I knew was Michael J Fox

00:00:49.950 00:00:51.500
Muhammad Ali but I didn't understand any

00:00:51.629 00:00:52.910
of the symptoms that were associated

00:00:52.949 00:00:57.170
with Parkinson's and it wasn't since my

00:00:57.329 00:00:59.479
initial symptoms started back in late

00:01:00.149 00:01:05.270
2010 early to 2011 I've been able to

00:01:05.430 00:01:07.850
lose about 60 pounds through diet and

00:01:08.280 00:01:10.280
exercise and for me that's been one of

00:01:10.409 00:01:11.960
the biggest things that has helped me

00:01:12.780 00:01:14.929
take control of this condition well

00:01:15.090 00:01:17.090
let's dive right in because I think it's

00:01:17.310 00:01:19.490
fair to say that you've done more with

00:01:19.740 00:01:20.270
your life

00:01:20.580 00:01:21.800
post Parkinson's and you would have

00:01:22.350 00:01:23.090
imagined when you got initially

00:01:23.700 00:01:25.039
diagnosed especially when it comes to

00:01:25.470 00:01:27.170
exercise what got you on the path to

00:01:27.659 00:01:28.910
exercise and then we'll talk more about

00:01:29.369 00:01:30.880
what you've done with it

00:01:31.890 00:01:33.770
so my doctor's kept telling me exercise

00:01:34.290 00:01:35.899
exercise you need to keep doing this I

00:01:36.810 00:01:38.510
my first experience with any type of

00:01:38.820 00:01:40.520
running was a jingle bell run it was a

00:01:41.009 00:01:42.859
5k event that he's held here in Las

00:01:42.899 00:01:45.800
Vegas and I I ran with the family it was

00:01:45.960 00:01:47.179
just a fun run

00:01:47.729 00:01:49.880
but the defining moment for me was when

00:01:49.920 00:01:53.149
I did an obstacle course race and when I

00:01:53.729 00:01:55.850
did that obstacle course race I would

00:01:56.040 00:01:57.800
say about six seven miles into the race

00:01:58.369 00:02:01.160
I flipped the 300 pounds higher fell

00:02:01.439 00:02:02.990
face-first in the process trying to flip

00:02:03.149 00:02:06.620
it several times but the moment that

00:02:06.810 00:02:09.350
really struck me this was the defining

00:02:09.569 00:02:10.969
moment for me was when I climbed an

00:02:11.340 00:02:13.820
eight-foot wall well I didn't really

00:02:13.950 00:02:15.380
that there was a technique to actually

00:02:15.750 00:02:17.750
climb a wall I just assumed that he just

00:02:18.420 00:02:20.180
you run and you just you grab the very

00:02:20.460 00:02:22.610
top of the wall well that's exactly what

00:02:22.740 00:02:24.680
I did I smashed my foot and when I

00:02:25.080 00:02:27.890
smashed my foot I literally felt like I

00:02:28.050 00:02:31.460
broke my foot so there was a gentleman

00:02:31.620 00:02:32.870
there that helped me out from Salt Lake

00:02:33.210 00:02:36.410
City and he asked me in my okay he's

00:02:36.930 00:02:39.350
referring to the epic fail that I had

00:02:39.660 00:02:42.230
with the wall himself so I told him I

00:02:42.390 00:02:45.470
had Parkinson's and for about three to

00:02:45.750 00:02:47.360
four miles I limped and i hobbled and

00:02:47.850 00:02:49.580
what got me through all of it was family

00:02:50.520 00:02:51.860
thinking in my children thinking of my

00:02:51.900 00:02:55.160
wife thinking about this is not how my

00:02:55.440 00:02:56.630
story's gonna end I'm gonna continue

00:02:56.790 00:02:59.210
doing this and from that point on that

00:02:59.880 00:03:02.360
lit a fire in me that is still burning

00:03:02.610 00:03:05.540
to this day that's fantastic and what

00:03:05.730 00:03:07.400
did your family how have they responded

00:03:07.440 00:03:09.050
to your exercise and the man you've

00:03:10.770 00:03:12.730
what kinds of things do they say to you

00:03:13.740 00:03:15.560
my children are extremely proud of me um

00:03:16.050 00:03:17.360
they go around they keep telling their

00:03:17.490 00:03:19.009
friends I was like my dad my dad is a

00:03:19.560 00:03:22.370
Spartan my dad he does all these amazing

00:03:24.650 00:03:27.140
things what can you do to help other

00:03:27.239 00:03:29.030
people because I read every day and I

00:03:29.070 00:03:30.170
think these are sometimes the most

00:03:30.630 00:03:32.840
important people in our community the

00:03:33.209 00:03:34.670
people who are newly diagnosed who say

00:03:34.980 00:03:36.229
what can I do what should i do they're

00:03:36.660 00:03:38.000
scared they're frightened what can you

00:03:38.160 00:03:40.130
do what do you do to make sure that

00:03:40.739 00:03:41.870
people who are just starting out of

00:03:42.000 00:03:43.130
their journey get the right information

00:03:43.920 00:03:46.850
and get started with getting moving um

00:03:47.430 00:03:48.650
the first thing that I would suggest is

00:03:48.840 00:03:50.660
go see a movement disorder specialist

00:03:51.390 00:03:52.550
not just the regular neurologist but

00:03:52.890 00:03:56.150
somebody who specifically knows about

00:03:56.519 00:04:00.259
Parkinson's and one thing that I can say

00:04:00.300 00:04:02.229
that helps me minimize my symptoms is

00:04:03.239 00:04:04.940
exercise keep moving whatever it is

00:04:06.440 00:04:09.170
dancing boxing obstacle course ready

00:04:09.420 00:04:11.120
seemed whatever you choose just keep

00:04:11.900 00:04:14.690
moving and you you mentioned getting to

00:04:14.760 00:04:16.880
a movement specialist in particular why

00:04:16.950 00:04:18.199
is that different than just going to a

00:04:18.600 00:04:19.550
general practitioner or even a

00:04:20.100 00:04:21.580
neurologist why a movement specialist

00:04:22.590 00:04:25.610
well for example I was diagnosed with a

00:04:25.950 00:04:27.200
regular neurologist

00:04:27.270 00:04:29.029
I was misdiagnosed for three years and

00:04:29.130 00:04:31.760
it was a familiar essential tremor for

00:04:31.919 00:04:34.070
three years they sent me in for a Dada

00:04:34.410 00:04:36.920
scan I came back to go see the

00:04:37.080 00:04:40.040
neurologist and all they said was just

00:04:40.380 00:04:42.790
as I suspected you have Parkinson's and

00:04:43.800 00:04:45.499
from there I was given medication I'll

00:04:45.870 00:04:48.469
see you in three weeks I wasn't told how

00:04:48.539 00:04:50.150
to take the medication that I wasn't my

00:04:50.639 00:04:52.089
experience wasn't the greatest with them

00:04:53.099 00:04:54.020
when I went to go see a movement

00:04:54.210 00:04:55.999
disorder specialist they spent over two

00:04:56.190 00:04:58.670
hours explaining to me that I can live a

00:04:58.889 00:05:01.790
full life but Parkinson's will not

00:05:02.130 00:05:04.400
define me that's fantastic

00:05:04.979 00:05:05.990
Christian have I missed anything is

00:05:06.060 00:05:06.980
