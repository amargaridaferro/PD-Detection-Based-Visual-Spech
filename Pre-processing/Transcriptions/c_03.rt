00:00:03.570 00:00:06.200
hello everyone my name is Becky Farley

00:00:06.420 00:00:08.600
and I'm a physical therapist and I'm the

00:00:09.030 00:00:10.339
founder for Parkinson wellness recovery

00:00:11.010 00:00:12.620
so welcome to the talk today I'm going

00:00:12.719 00:00:16.010
to give a foundation about Parkinson

00:00:16.170 00:00:18.439
disease and overview and I appreciate

00:00:18.630 00:00:22.490
you watching the video I I usually give

00:00:22.650 00:00:26.060
this talk at the retreat but it takes a

00:00:26.220 00:00:27.830
lot of time and it takes time away from

00:00:28.349 00:00:29.599
other really important things like

00:00:30.390 00:00:32.120
exercise and how to deal with the

00:00:32.579 00:00:35.030
non-motor symptoms and neuroplasticity

00:00:36.110 00:00:39.380
so I'm very excited to put this an

00:00:39.930 00:00:41.660
online version you will receive the

00:00:42.170 00:00:44.000
slides after the retreat you'll get the

00:00:44.280 00:00:45.680
slides of all the speakers and other

00:00:46.110 00:00:48.319
handouts that we have so thank you very

00:00:48.719 00:00:51.350
much I won't be this big life-size the

00:00:51.510 00:00:53.779
whole time I'm going to switch mode so

00:00:53.820 00:00:55.250
that you'll see a little box up in the

00:00:55.440 00:00:57.950
right corner where you can see me but

00:00:58.829 00:01:00.770
mostly it is used to be the slides the

00:01:01.140 00:01:02.569
purpose of the talk is to give you a

00:01:03.270 00:01:04.490
foundation and language for the partners

00:01:04.769 00:01:06.620
and the people with Parkinson disease so

00:01:06.659 00:01:08.690
that everyone has a common level of

00:01:09.740 00:01:12.070
understanding I'm going to talk about

00:01:13.080 00:01:14.270
you know the prevalence and incidence

00:01:14.820 00:01:16.880
who gets Parkinson's and then I'll spend

00:01:17.159 00:01:18.740
time on the cause of Parkinson disease

00:01:19.259 00:01:21.530
they'll be a little break in there and

00:01:22.229 00:01:24.109
then I'll end with medications and deep

00:01:24.360 00:01:27.560
brain stimulation so you can fast order

00:01:27.750 00:01:29.480
this if you'd like but there's so much

00:01:29.759 00:01:31.730
new information on alpha-synuclein and

00:01:31.890 00:01:33.740
the guts and the causes of Parkinson

00:01:34.259 00:01:37.789
diseases and new therapies that I find

00:01:37.890 00:01:40.399
this all very exciting and it motivates

00:01:40.650 00:01:42.560
me all the time to stay on top of the

00:01:42.869 00:01:45.859
literature so I'm doing my very best to

00:01:45.960 00:01:50.450
make it information that can help you

00:01:50.790 00:01:53.090
and your fight with Parkinson's and give

00:01:54.200 00:01:56.179
you good background so you can

00:01:56.850 00:01:58.310
communicate with your physicians and the

00:01:58.770 00:02:01.399
speakers at the retreat so thank you

00:02:01.710 00:02:02.359
very much

00:02:02.460 00:02:04.069
and I'm going to switch modes and get

00:02:13.530 00:02:15.110
all right so I want to talk first just

00:02:15.329 00:02:17.140
about some facts about Parkinson disease

00:02:18.150 00:02:20.149
it was first described by British

00:02:20.640 00:02:23.240
surgeon dr. James Parkinson's in 1817 he

00:02:23.609 00:02:25.160
kept this amazing book which you can get

00:02:25.379 00:02:29.270
online at Amazon it's about six cases

00:02:29.519 00:02:32.210
that he observed and he was probably one

00:02:32.250 00:02:36.199
of the first physicians to really write

00:02:36.510 00:02:40.509
the job description for a neurologist

00:02:41.519 00:02:42.440
it's the second most common

00:02:42.989 00:02:44.089
neurodegenerative disease after

00:02:45.090 00:02:48.110
Alzheimer's and in fact there's a story

00:02:48.389 00:02:49.670
we'll talk about that there's really an

00:02:50.720 00:02:55.399
epidemic over the next 25 years it's the

00:02:55.590 00:02:57.199
most common form of a clinical syndrome

00:02:57.689 00:02:59.839
called parkinsonism we'll talk about

00:03:00.120 00:03:02.750
what that means the diagnosis requires a

00:03:03.480 00:03:04.970
neurologist using their skills or

00:03:05.459 00:03:07.909
clinical skills to identify the Cardinal

00:03:08.189 00:03:09.949
motor symptoms which are our resting

00:03:10.379 00:03:13.520
tremor rigidity and brady kinesia which

00:03:13.829 00:03:16.270
means slow and small movement

00:03:17.280 00:03:18.890
these are physicians that specialize in

00:03:19.680 00:03:21.860
movement disorders and just seeing a

00:03:22.049 00:03:23.300
physician that is a movement disorder

00:03:24.299 00:03:25.939
specialized physician can improve the

00:03:26.340 00:03:28.490
accuracy of your diagnosis the speed at

00:03:28.530 00:03:30.349
which you get that diagnosis and your

00:03:30.780 00:03:31.159
quality of life

00:03:31.470 00:03:34.430
and even things like reducing

00:03:35.159 00:03:36.890
hospitalizations and decreasing the rate

00:03:37.400 00:03:39.920
of fractures things like that in the

00:03:40.139 00:03:43.339
long term the first motor symptoms for

00:03:43.949 00:03:45.770
Parkinson disease appear when 50 to 60

00:03:46.260 00:03:48.080
percent of the dopamine neurons have

00:03:48.739 00:03:53.360
died in 1961 is the first time there is

00:03:53.400 00:03:55.849
a successful clinical trial using

00:03:57.019 00:03:58.969
levodopa which is still the gold

00:03:59.269 00:04:00.949
standard medication for people with

00:04:01.530 00:04:04.300
Parkinson disease

00:04:04.700 00:04:06.670
right now they're trying to find out how

00:04:06.740 00:04:09.220
to really focus on better delivery so

00:04:09.260 00:04:11.320
that there are fewer side-effects and

00:04:12.080 00:04:14.020
that it can be maintained at a chronic

00:04:14.300 00:04:16.180
sort of dosage over the course of a day

00:04:16.700 00:04:19.509
instead of fluctuations so there's a lot

00:04:19.609 00:04:23.520
of new potential delivery systems for

00:04:24.530 00:04:27.070
levodopa or it's always given with

00:04:27.530 00:04:28.659
carbidopa so it's called levodopa

00:04:29.270 00:04:31.120
carbidopa or Sinemet all those are the

00:04:31.340 00:04:32.310
same thing

00:04:33.320 00:04:35.200
exercise is medicine for people with

00:04:35.780 00:04:36.909
Parkinson disease it truly is a

00:04:37.370 00:04:39.250
physiological tool to create change from

00:04:39.380 00:04:41.650
the inside we'll talk more about that at

00:04:41.690 00:04:44.820
the retreat but it's my motivation

00:04:45.830 00:04:48.010
because there's more compelling data on

00:04:48.350 00:04:49.960
the role of exercise in Parkinson

00:04:50.150 00:04:51.580
disease and any other neurodegenerative

00:04:52.550 00:04:56.830
disease and I know you have a lot of

00:04:57.350 00:04:59.110
potential to get better and stay better

00:04:59.450 00:05:02.620
it isn't easy as it says the caveat of

00:05:03.290 00:05:05.680
exercise is you have to move but to stop

00:05:06.260 00:05:08.440
despite exercise and medication there's

00:05:08.780 00:05:11.830
still a battle or a barrier that we have

00:05:12.190 00:05:15.040
to help you improve your participation

00:05:15.410 00:05:19.659
in life because that continues to be a

00:05:19.940 00:05:21.730
problem it's not enough to just exercise

00:05:22.010 00:05:23.290
three days a week it's really about

00:05:23.780 00:05:25.620
doing the things that you love

00:05:26.630 00:05:29.279
overcoming postural instability and gait

00:05:30.289 00:05:32.529
disorders like freezing of gait problems

00:05:32.720 00:05:35.580
with turning and musculoskeletal

00:05:36.590 00:05:37.810
complications things that the rigidity

00:05:38.150 00:05:40.420
is constantly pulling you and deflection

00:05:40.640 00:05:42.279
and causing problems at the shoulder and

00:05:42.410 00:05:45.460
the hip so you're gonna still need

00:05:46.070 00:05:49.210
targeted rehab and coaching for life and

00:05:49.580 00:05:52.360
we'll talk about then define nut at the

00:05:52.700 00:05:56.980
retreat next week exercise the good news

00:05:57.169 00:05:59.860
about it is it may actually reduce the

00:05:59.900 00:06:01.480
amount of medication your need for

00:06:02.390 00:06:05.740
medication over time this is not

00:06:06.500 00:06:07.980
Parkinson disease in this picture

00:06:08.990 00:06:11.050
there's really a revolution that people

00:06:11.690 00:06:13.480
trying to ban this picture from

00:06:14.060 00:06:16.130
textbooks and medical

00:06:16.710 00:06:20.630
talks it is it has since 1960s been the

00:06:21.030 00:06:22.220
picture that represents Parkinson

00:06:22.380 00:06:26.060
disease and and andhere's

00:06:26.880 00:06:28.400
Lyons who has a Norwegian video

00:06:29.010 00:06:30.620
journalist I met him at the world

00:06:31.260 00:06:36.200
Parkinson Congress in 2016 and he is he

00:06:36.240 00:06:38.300
put on a whole exhibit it took up the

00:06:38.490 00:06:41.810
whole reception area practically showing

00:06:43.220 00:06:46.790
people new images to represent people

00:06:46.980 00:06:49.550
that have Parkinson disease it's quite

00:06:50.160 00:06:51.350
remarkable you can go to his Facebook

00:06:51.390 00:06:54.220
page and see what the exhibit look like

00:06:55.230 00:06:57.230
people are starting to use his pictures

00:06:57.480 00:07:00.260
and images he's making them available so

00:07:00.420 00:07:04.130
they can be used in in medical talks and

00:07:04.650 00:07:06.620
hopefully in the future we will get rid

00:07:06.660 00:07:11.000
of this sort of image of you know older

00:07:13.010 00:07:15.610
males shuffling gait stooped posture

00:07:16.620 00:07:18.260
because there's a lot more to Parkinson

00:07:18.480 00:07:21.770
disease than that that kind of image

00:07:22.050 00:07:27.380
also does a really negative right form

00:07:29.210 00:07:31.640
of Education to the public as well as

00:07:32.100 00:07:33.590
for people with Parkinson disease it's

00:07:34.230 00:07:35.090
overwhelming to see those pictures

00:07:35.820 00:07:37.640
especially when if you were to pull

00:07:37.980 00:07:39.560
three thousand people but living with

00:07:40.170 00:07:41.990
Parkinson disease and they were asked

00:07:42.180 00:07:44.030
what's the most challenging aspect of

00:07:44.220 00:07:46.370
living with Parkinson's disease stigma

00:07:46.680 00:07:49.280
if you look at that list is way stands

00:07:49.590 00:07:52.970
out as the most challenging issue so we

00:07:53.190 00:07:58.130
don't want to do anything to add to that

00:07:58.530 00:08:01.580
sort of negative plasticity that's

00:08:02.190 00:08:03.350
occurring and that tendency for the

00:08:03.570 00:08:06.620
brain and Parkinson's to really absorb

00:08:07.320 00:08:09.470
negative thoughts we want to empower

00:08:09.870 00:08:12.980
people with education and shine a new

00:08:13.250 00:08:15.740
light so this is one of his images this

00:08:15.990 00:08:18.380
is Parkinson disease people of all ages

00:08:18.720 00:08:21.080
all walks of life people with

00:08:21.870 00:08:23.960
disabilities and seniors and farmers and

00:08:24.870 00:08:28.280
CEOs and there's many of these images

00:08:29.100 00:08:29.830
these are probably most

00:08:29.930 00:08:31.240
in our region because that's where he

00:08:31.520 00:08:33.550
lives and I got to meet him he's on the

00:08:33.770 00:08:36.579
far left when I was there and he is

00:08:37.370 00:08:40.899
continuing to take this on the road so

00:08:41.060 00:08:43.659
the prevalence means represents total

00:08:44.000 00:08:45.730
number of people living with Parkinson

00:08:45.890 00:08:49.300
disease in the world or in the u.s. it's

00:08:49.550 00:08:51.280
the least accurate of the statistics

00:08:51.500 00:08:53.769
because well some countries don't have

00:08:54.230 00:08:55.000
health care they don't have a

00:08:55.670 00:08:57.730
neurologist they don't have really

00:08:58.839 00:09:00.850
statistics and although that is

00:09:01.250 00:09:02.950
improving greatly people and some

00:09:03.440 00:09:04.570
countries are beginning to do

00:09:05.300 00:09:07.630
door-to-door surveys training people in

00:09:07.700 00:09:09.900
the community to recognize Parkinson's

00:09:10.910 00:09:14.500
trying to identify how many are really

00:09:15.320 00:09:19.030
around in the world current stats would

00:09:19.279 00:09:21.910
say that there's per 100,000 people that

00:09:22.160 00:09:23.560
are one hundred three hundred and forty

00:09:23.839 00:09:27.370
seven the rate increases with age you

00:09:27.740 00:09:29.500
can see on the right starting with 30

00:09:29.990 00:09:33.490
going up to eighty it goes up in terms

00:09:33.680 00:09:37.740
of one to four percent men and women

00:09:38.750 00:09:40.690
there's a greater risk for men greater

00:09:41.060 00:09:44.410
prevalence in men 85% of the people with

00:09:45.020 00:09:47.860
Parkinson's are over 65 however 15

00:09:48.320 00:09:50.320
percent of them were diagnosed before 40

00:09:50.510 00:09:52.769
years old and living with it longer

00:09:53.779 00:09:58.090
idiopathic a 90% of the cases really

00:09:58.279 00:10:00.370
have an unknown cause although we'll

00:10:00.500 00:10:01.540
learn there's more and more

00:10:02.330 00:10:03.910
understanding of the genetics and maybe

00:10:04.250 00:10:06.699
different causes hereditary people with

00:10:07.430 00:10:09.160
familial Parkinson's and have family

00:10:09.560 00:10:12.310
members even if it skips generations is

00:10:12.620 00:10:19.150
around 10% and I'm sorry reddit areas

00:10:19.400 00:10:22.210
when it's in every family my genic first

00:10:22.940 00:10:28.110
having it in a relative 15 to 25 percent

00:10:29.120 00:10:31.840
so recently Allison Willis did for her

00:10:32.750 00:10:34.570
dissertation and now continued to work

00:10:34.760 00:10:36.579
on that in this area was one of the

00:10:36.830 00:10:39.710
first to use the u.s. Medicare

00:10:40.019 00:10:42.199
debase to really try to get more

00:10:42.449 00:10:43.819
accurate measurements at least in the

00:10:44.189 00:10:45.800
u.s. of number of people living with

00:10:46.470 00:10:49.420
Parkinson disease you can see worldwide

00:10:50.430 00:10:52.460
there's a greater prevalence in Europe

00:10:52.649 00:10:54.860
and North and South America than some of

00:10:54.990 00:10:57.650
those other countries as far as it goes

00:10:57.870 00:11:00.740
in the u.s. ethnically Hispanic more

00:11:00.930 00:11:03.290
than non-hispanic white more than Asians

00:11:03.569 00:11:05.869
more than black the geographic

00:11:06.470 00:11:08.240
distribution she was the first to

00:11:08.459 00:11:10.309
recognize this through the database that

00:11:10.529 00:11:13.249
it's two to ten times higher than

00:11:14.069 00:11:16.040
western and southern us counties and

00:11:16.259 00:11:18.679
she's called it the Parkinson Belt and

00:11:19.230 00:11:20.629
then there and you can see that there's

00:11:21.360 00:11:24.879
you know a very dense population

00:11:25.889 00:11:28.519
industrial part of our country and

00:11:28.649 00:11:31.069
you'll notice in the green we're at

00:11:31.740 00:11:34.220
Arizona's down there on the left that's

00:11:34.529 00:11:36.759
only because most of the people that

00:11:37.769 00:11:40.790
live in the Northeast um it must be

00:11:41.550 00:11:42.559
summertime and they're not visiting

00:11:43.230 00:11:44.990
Arizona because then we get a lot of

00:11:45.329 00:11:46.819
people with Parkinson's visiting or

00:11:47.550 00:11:49.970
coming to specific areas where they live

00:11:50.370 00:11:57.019
and retire so I encourage you to watch

00:11:57.089 00:11:59.960
the Michael J Fox foundation third

00:12:00.660 00:12:02.389
thirsty webinars you can go on his site

00:12:02.430 00:12:05.059
and even view the past ones which this

00:12:05.250 00:12:08.720
is one of them from March 15th and dr.

00:12:09.420 00:12:12.740
vos bloom and Ray Dorsey two leaders in

00:12:12.839 00:12:15.559
the field of movement disorders had a

00:12:15.990 00:12:17.780
conversation and in it were interviewed

00:12:17.819 00:12:20.269
by Dave Iverson who does have Parkinson

00:12:20.430 00:12:22.790
disease and he's been a journalist his

00:12:23.009 00:12:25.670
whole life with NPR and it's he does

00:12:25.939 00:12:30.259
great seminars so this one was really

00:12:30.629 00:12:32.679
about this concept of an epidemic and

00:12:33.689 00:12:37.189
they proposed that since 1990 the

00:12:37.709 00:12:39.590
prevalence has doubled and they

00:12:40.230 00:12:41.840
anticipate in the next 25 years that

00:12:42.059 00:12:46.309
will double again why is that the case

00:12:46.980 00:12:49.210
when people are living longer

00:12:50.220 00:12:51.889
there's awesome a decline in smoking

00:12:52.439 00:12:53.060
rates and you're

00:12:53.430 00:12:56.450
learn that smoking is protective for

00:12:57.180 00:12:59.060
Parkinson disease not something you

00:12:59.310 00:13:01.340
should do but a lot of research is

00:13:01.500 00:13:03.320
looking at what are the components of

00:13:03.930 00:13:07.670
nicotine that may be protective but

00:13:08.070 00:13:09.650
because there's fewer smoke people

00:13:10.610 00:13:13.010
smoking that may contribute to a greater

00:13:14.000 00:13:15.580
prevalence also there's a lot of

00:13:16.590 00:13:17.540
underreporting like I mentioned for

00:13:18.090 00:13:20.540
prevalence it's hard to identify where

00:13:21.120 00:13:26.090
people are not everyone goes to a doctor

00:13:26.490 00:13:28.730
much less a movement disorders physician

00:13:29.580 00:13:32.930
they may never have access to anyone but

00:13:33.000 00:13:35.930
a primary care and so often they don't

00:13:36.810 00:13:41.660
get reported their primary directive of

00:13:41.940 00:13:45.980
this webinar and purpose was to talk

00:13:46.200 00:13:48.590
about the needs to advocate and take

00:13:49.580 00:13:52.790
action and they suggested for research

00:13:53.070 00:13:55.190
funding for one with that kind of

00:13:55.470 00:13:58.250
prevalence and anticipating doubling

00:13:58.410 00:14:02.980
again by 2040 banning harmful pesticides

00:14:03.990 00:14:06.050
so there are so many toxins in the

00:14:06.540 00:14:07.460
environment that have been shown to

00:14:08.450 00:14:10.640
contribute to Parkinson disease and

00:14:10.860 00:14:14.960
other neurodegenerative diseases however

00:14:15.330 00:14:17.120
they are still available many of them

00:14:17.480 00:14:20.240
and even if they do ban certain ones and

00:14:20.340 00:14:21.770
they're taken off the market they're

00:14:22.140 00:14:24.590
still in the soil and getting into food

00:14:25.080 00:14:28.490
and and for feed for animals and all of

00:14:28.530 00:14:31.730
that so it seems a very least thing that

00:14:32.070 00:14:34.250
we can do is start with how the

00:14:35.220 00:14:36.710
environment what role can we play in the

00:14:37.320 00:14:40.490
environment to reduce risk factors we

00:14:40.530 00:14:42.590
can also increase protective factors

00:14:42.870 00:14:45.560
like exercise and rehab services that

00:14:46.350 00:14:48.200
definitely may be protective as well as

00:14:48.900 00:14:50.570
can help people live longer and better

00:14:50.940 00:14:53.330
with Parkinson disease and a balanced

00:14:53.580 00:14:55.520
diet maybe may play quite a role

00:14:56.310 00:14:57.350
especially with the role of the

00:14:57.480 00:15:01.670
environment and got and so we'll talk a

00:15:01.920 00:15:02.930
little bit about that and we'll have a

00:15:03.390 00:15:05.000
speaker at the retreat who will go into

00:15:05.190 00:15:06.980
more detail

00:15:07.950 00:15:10.670
the incidence is the number of people

00:15:11.250 00:15:13.810
who are real newly diagnosed every year

00:15:14.820 00:15:17.120
these numbers are a little more accurate

00:15:18.500 00:15:23.000
and across the overall incidence is

00:15:23.460 00:15:25.070
fourteen to twenty five point six people

00:15:25.260 00:15:29.240
per 100,000 the more people living that

00:15:29.280 00:15:32.270
are over 65 in any one region of course

00:15:32.400 00:15:33.350
you're going to have more newly

00:15:33.870 00:15:36.980
diagnosed people in Tucson you can see

00:15:37.110 00:15:38.780
at the bottom we have a population of

00:15:39.200 00:15:43.490
about 600,000 so I've just estimated how

00:15:43.710 00:15:47.120
many I might anticipate every year being

00:15:47.750 00:15:50.900
diagnosed and our goal at our PWR Jim

00:15:51.210 00:15:53.000
and Tucson is to try to find a way to

00:15:53.400 00:15:55.520
meet the needs of those people it's a

00:15:55.710 00:15:58.700
big challenge and it's going to require

00:15:58.950 00:16:02.210
some new paradigms the age of onset

00:16:03.030 00:16:05.920
typically is between 55 and 65 years

00:16:06.930 00:16:08.630
there is a younger group you can see the

00:16:09.300 00:16:11.000
percentages are 10 to 15% that are

00:16:11.490 00:16:13.580
diagnosed between 21 and 50 years old

00:16:14.120 00:16:16.970
and there is a later onset Parkinson's

00:16:17.880 00:16:21.860
in each of these age groups of course

00:16:22.140 00:16:24.290
are going to have they're gonna have

00:16:24.510 00:16:25.970
different levels of fitness different

00:16:26.400 00:16:28.790
interest in fitness different numbers

00:16:29.100 00:16:31.310
and types of comorbidities their

00:16:32.010 00:16:33.230
motivation and personal goals would be

00:16:33.660 00:16:34.910
different they will even respond to

00:16:35.760 00:16:37.760
medication or exercise differently and

00:16:38.310 00:16:39.850
in fact everything we know about

00:16:40.860 00:16:43.880
medication and exercise all of that

00:16:44.100 00:16:46.490
research is done in this group of

00:16:46.880 00:16:50.900
typical 55 to 65 year olds so there's

00:16:51.210 00:16:56.270
very few large studies on both exercise

00:16:56.490 00:17:00.640
and medications for these other groups

00:17:01.650 00:17:03.980
the diagnosis of Parkinson's well it

00:17:04.470 00:17:06.590
starts with you there are official

00:17:07.589 00:17:09.890
diagnostic criteria from the UK you can

00:17:10.080 00:17:11.420
look them up I have the reference at the

00:17:12.110 00:17:15.230
bottom and the first thing is to

00:17:15.959 00:17:18.770
diagnose parkinsonian syndrome so the

00:17:19.260 00:17:20.990
absolute most important I know

00:17:21.750 00:17:23.510
symptom that a physician will look for

00:17:23.579 00:17:26.360
it clinically is evidence for small slow

00:17:27.179 00:17:29.000
movements that's not just voluntary

00:17:29.610 00:17:31.180
movements but those are postural

00:17:32.190 00:17:34.840
responses to the loss of balance so

00:17:35.850 00:17:37.970
that's both voluntary and automatic

00:17:38.400 00:17:41.779
sorts of responses brady kinesia is the

00:17:42.510 00:17:44.360
number-one high most highly correlated

00:17:45.299 00:17:48.890
symptom with dopamine levels more brady

00:17:49.520 00:17:52.330
kinesia increased loss of dopamine and

00:17:53.340 00:17:54.950
brady kinesia is really a force

00:17:55.830 00:17:57.680
regulation problem the brain is not

00:17:58.500 00:18:01.669
driving enough force for the needs of

00:18:01.830 00:18:04.399
the task so movements come out too small

00:18:04.830 00:18:07.549
too slow the other thing they look for

00:18:07.770 00:18:10.010
is one of the following either rigidity

00:18:10.260 00:18:12.140
which is really this Co contraction that

00:18:12.720 00:18:13.460
contributes to the loss of

00:18:14.039 00:18:15.529
musculoskeletal your alignment your

00:18:16.169 00:18:18.110
posture becomes stooped the shoulders

00:18:18.299 00:18:19.820
are tight the hips are tight all of that

00:18:20.309 00:18:22.130
limits and affects your balance and

00:18:22.549 00:18:24.820
mobility and it can contribute to pain

00:18:25.830 00:18:28.220
or they look for a specific type of

00:18:28.919 00:18:32.149
resting tremor and or some loss of

00:18:33.000 00:18:35.000
postural instability or balance problems

00:18:35.490 00:18:39.740
they're not caused by sort of the other

00:18:40.679 00:18:43.100
other systems like vision vestibular

00:18:43.770 00:18:46.520
other parts of the brain that's

00:18:46.919 00:18:47.960
something that they would relate to

00:18:48.210 00:18:51.320
having Parkinson disease so brady

00:18:51.600 00:18:52.970
kinesia first is the hardest thing to

00:18:53.400 00:18:54.950
measure especially in early diagnosed

00:18:55.260 00:18:57.950
people because most of the time you can

00:18:58.260 00:19:01.310
override brady kinesia early on and the

00:19:01.799 00:19:03.289
physician in order to test if you have

00:19:03.750 00:19:08.450
it may need to have you do things under

00:19:09.299 00:19:10.700
cognitive load or dual tasking

00:19:11.700 00:19:13.490
multitasking they may want to watch you

00:19:13.710 00:19:15.770
move when you don't know it so they

00:19:15.929 00:19:17.390
might help you move around the room or

00:19:17.520 00:19:21.710
walk out and come back so it's that's

00:19:22.080 00:19:23.510
one reason they can't diagnose it right

00:19:23.669 00:19:24.830
away is that they don't see brady

00:19:25.700 00:19:27.919
kinesia so it's important that you also

00:19:28.470 00:19:31.490
note it yourself at home and work and if

00:19:31.620 00:19:33.649
you have noticed that it's just taking

00:19:33.750 00:19:34.450
you longer to get

00:19:34.640 00:19:38.020
ready in the morning that you're just

00:19:38.390 00:19:40.060
having more difficulty with one side of

00:19:40.160 00:19:43.140
the body getting it to go fast enough

00:19:44.150 00:19:46.090
the next thing they do is they just try

00:19:46.160 00:19:50.470
to rule out any other kind of criteria

00:19:51.250 00:19:53.170
or diagnostic you know from a

00:19:53.930 00:19:55.510
Diagnostics perspective rule out other

00:19:56.210 00:19:58.330
diseases so they have a whole host of

00:19:58.550 00:19:59.740
things that they would go through just

00:19:59.900 00:20:02.320
by watching you over the course of six

00:20:02.720 00:20:06.850
months to a year or more and this gives

00:20:06.980 00:20:09.040
you another idea of the number of things

00:20:09.470 00:20:10.600
going on in the brain of a movement

00:20:10.850 00:20:12.790
disorder specialist or thinking about in

00:20:12.920 00:20:15.310
the center is this person idiopathic

00:20:16.010 00:20:18.220
Parkinson's disease or do they have one

00:20:18.260 00:20:20.530
of these other types of atypical or

00:20:21.260 00:20:23.620
secondary parkinsonism 'z that have a

00:20:24.020 00:20:25.270
different progression they involve

00:20:25.370 00:20:28.420
different parts of the brain the ones on

00:20:28.520 00:20:31.180
the left secondary may be things that

00:20:32.030 00:20:33.640
will not progress as fast or they might

00:20:33.860 00:20:35.980
go away if you remove the tumor or you

00:20:36.170 00:20:38.440
remove the drugs that may be inducing

00:20:38.630 00:20:41.170
those symptoms so you can see there's a

00:20:41.630 00:20:44.730
lot of things that they have to follow

00:20:45.740 00:20:47.860
because there's no specific test for

00:20:48.500 00:20:50.470
idiopathic Parkinson's disease that they

00:20:50.660 00:20:53.410
have to try to do clinical tests and

00:20:54.110 00:20:56.320
observe ations sometimes they do MRIs

00:20:56.360 00:21:01.540
and other things to rule out again

00:21:02.120 00:21:03.670
everything we know about Parkinson

00:21:03.830 00:21:06.340
disease and medications and exercise is

00:21:06.500 00:21:08.920
in that center group and the good news

00:21:09.230 00:21:12.940
is that 75% of the people that go see a

00:21:13.490 00:21:14.710
movement disorders physician to be

00:21:15.380 00:21:18.280
diagnosed with parkinsonism turn out to

00:21:18.320 00:21:22.000
have Parkinson disease so that is good

00:21:22.640 00:21:24.520
because that is what they know the most

00:21:24.830 00:21:26.970
about and have the most therapeutic

00:21:27.980 00:21:30.850
options in terms of meds surgery and

00:21:31.430 00:21:39.340
exercise to offer finally after they are

00:21:39.710 00:21:42.250
fairly confident that this is car

00:21:42.950 00:21:44.380
Parkinson disease they're going to

00:21:44.840 00:21:46.450
continue to look for three or more of

00:21:46.610 00:21:48.159
the following positive

00:21:48.590 00:21:50.440
bacteria that's required to have

00:21:51.519 00:21:55.840
definite Parkinson disease so are your

00:21:56.090 00:21:57.849
symptoms on one side of the body and do

00:21:57.980 00:22:00.759
they stay on one side of the body you

00:22:00.919 00:22:02.499
may get symptoms on the other side but

00:22:02.720 00:22:05.259
they're always worse on one side is it

00:22:05.929 00:22:07.299
progressing or is or the symptoms been

00:22:07.429 00:22:08.979
the same over the past two and three

00:22:10.570 00:22:13.239
years again persistent asymmetry

00:22:13.429 00:22:15.879
it starts off one-sided and there's

00:22:16.159 00:22:18.970
really no specific insidious just means

00:22:19.489 00:22:20.950
you can't really pinpoint when it

00:22:21.440 00:22:24.909
started it was so gradual if you respond

00:22:25.519 00:22:26.979
to levodopa when they give you your

00:22:27.230 00:22:29.049
first dose and you have a great response

00:22:29.269 00:22:31.479
and get a kick that's a very good

00:22:31.970 00:22:33.070
indication that you have Parkinson

00:22:34.149 00:22:36.789
disease if you are sensitive to the

00:22:37.399 00:22:38.409
medication and over time you develop

00:22:38.869 00:22:41.220
these dyskinesias which are involuntary

00:22:42.340 00:22:44.889
movements they can be really small and

00:22:45.019 00:22:47.259
the extremities the neck the jaw the

00:22:47.809 00:22:52.869
face the head off so they're gonna see

00:22:53.059 00:22:54.849
if you continue to respond to levodopa

00:22:55.460 00:22:56.979
over the course of five years or more

00:22:57.259 00:23:01.210
you may not think you are but you know

00:23:01.489 00:23:03.070
when you if you were to stop taking the

00:23:03.679 00:23:04.899
medications and be tested in an off

00:23:05.600 00:23:06.909
condition your symptoms would be worse

00:23:08.559 00:23:12.099
and then over the course of 10 years or

00:23:13.149 00:23:16.180
more they would have specific

00:23:16.730 00:23:19.479
expectations and be able to and all of

00:23:19.820 00:23:21.570
those three of those would be enough to

00:23:22.580 00:23:23.889
decide that you have definitive

00:23:24.679 00:23:27.639
Parkinson disease so unfortunately it is

00:23:27.679 00:23:30.190
a it does take a while it takes us

00:23:30.559 00:23:32.830
really the neurologists with a very good

00:23:33.080 00:23:36.700
set of clinical skills and someone who

00:23:36.980 00:23:38.739
sees a lot of Parkinson disease that

00:23:38.869 00:23:42.549
will only make this process faster but

00:23:42.889 00:23:44.080
that doesn't mean you need to wait for

00:23:44.450 00:23:46.720
the diagnosis even if you have nothing

00:23:46.970 00:23:48.789
but some slow movements that are worse

00:23:49.100 00:23:51.340
on one side of your body that's the time

00:23:51.619 00:23:54.639
to start exercising it's so important

00:23:54.679 00:23:57.099
that is a window of opportunity to

00:23:57.639 00:23:59.289
really use X or

00:23:59.539 00:24:05.759
sighs as medicine so like I mentioned

00:24:06.769 00:24:09.430
75% of the people that are diagnosed

00:24:09.739 00:24:11.739
with parkinsonism at the beginning turn

00:24:11.929 00:24:13.749
out to have idiopathic Parkinson's

00:24:14.570 00:24:19.029
disease and again we can almost predict

00:24:19.850 00:24:22.200
what how you'll respond so when I do

00:24:23.210 00:24:24.369
assessments and I get to see people in

00:24:24.470 00:24:26.289
the gym with Parkinson disease I know

00:24:26.960 00:24:29.379
from the very beginning after watching

00:24:29.629 00:24:31.389
them and move having them move and

00:24:31.999 00:24:35.529
exercise with me I can predict how good

00:24:35.720 00:24:38.080
this person's going to respond if they

00:24:38.419 00:24:40.149
have Parkinson disease if someone comes

00:24:40.399 00:24:42.009
and I do that assessment and they have

00:24:42.289 00:24:45.190
some other type of parkinsonism it's

00:24:45.559 00:24:48.220
much more difficult for me to know what

00:24:48.379 00:24:51.129
is the best exercise program or how this

00:24:51.559 00:24:52.989
person will respond to different types

00:24:53.179 00:24:58.690
of exercise so it makes it much more

00:24:58.940 00:25:01.450
challenging and also that is why people

00:25:01.669 00:25:03.789
that have any sort of a typical

00:25:04.129 00:25:05.979
progression or response should

00:25:06.769 00:25:07.930
definitely see a physical therapist

00:25:08.570 00:25:11.009
right away I think everybody should but

00:25:12.019 00:25:14.139
those those individuals should not wait

00:25:14.450 00:25:15.700
they need to be started on a progressive

00:25:17.139 00:25:21.519
program ASAP everybody does but

00:25:22.190 00:25:24.489
especially those people there are

00:25:24.980 00:25:26.379
different types of even idiopathic

00:25:27.019 00:25:28.810
Parkinson's disease some people have a

00:25:29.179 00:25:31.440
tremor and that's the primary symptom

00:25:32.450 00:25:34.090
maybe a little slowness but the tremor

00:25:34.340 00:25:35.799
is the thing that bothers them the most

00:25:36.080 00:25:39.070
and then other people have more rigidity

00:25:39.590 00:25:42.039
and and it affects their gait and

00:25:42.409 00:25:44.529
balance postural instability more and

00:25:45.499 00:25:48.159
that's abbreviated the PID D postural

00:25:48.259 00:25:50.649
instability gait difficulties then then

00:25:50.869 00:25:52.149
there's people that have sort of more of

00:25:52.279 00:25:56.139
a mixture so there's probably many many

00:25:56.509 00:25:59.169
more types of these sort of subtypes of

00:25:59.509 00:26:02.379
idiopathic Parkinson's disease and the

00:26:02.720 00:26:04.840
more we understand these subtypes the

00:26:05.119 00:26:09.310
better we can develop targeted exercise

00:26:09.980 00:26:11.710
approaches and I'm sure

00:26:12.049 00:26:14.139
also targeted approaches to medications

00:26:14.509 00:26:20.230
and surgeries so what other things do we

00:26:20.389 00:26:22.240
know about the differences of people

00:26:22.490 00:26:23.610
with Parkinson disease

00:26:24.620 00:26:26.379
well the tremor is slower progressing

00:26:26.659 00:26:31.299
than the P IgD subtype the posture and

00:26:31.519 00:26:33.730
gaits instability group also is

00:26:34.100 00:26:36.159
associated with faster rate of cognitive

00:26:36.289 00:26:38.499
decline and a higher incidence over the

00:26:38.720 00:26:42.519
long term of dementia people that are a

00:26:42.740 00:26:44.139
little bit older and have the later

00:26:44.450 00:26:48.659
onset Parkinson's disease have a greater

00:26:49.669 00:26:51.549
risk of getting the Parkinson's and gait

00:26:52.990 00:26:55.560
disorder younger onset Parkinson disease

00:26:56.570 00:26:58.659
their their distribution of symptoms is

00:26:59.149 00:27:00.610
different they have more tremor more

00:27:01.179 00:27:03.669
rigidity more dystonia which is this

00:27:04.490 00:27:05.680
cramping that can be in the hands or

00:27:05.720 00:27:08.409
feet or the trunk and a higher rate of

00:27:09.350 00:27:11.230
dyskinesias which is again a side effect

00:27:11.419 00:27:15.100
of the levodopa medication women have

00:27:15.500 00:27:17.590
later onset Parkinson's disease more

00:27:18.139 00:27:20.519
typically a higher prevalence of tremor

00:27:21.529 00:27:25.749
slower rate of motor impairment the

00:27:26.330 00:27:29.860
non-motor symptoms in women can be

00:27:30.470 00:27:32.230
characterized more by the emotional

00:27:32.509 00:27:34.830
symptoms of anxiety depression and

00:27:35.860 00:27:38.610
constipation which is an autonomic

00:27:39.620 00:27:41.740
symptom that can occur even 25 years

00:27:42.320 00:27:45.789
before Parkinson disease in men the

00:27:46.250 00:27:49.029
non-motor symptoms are more likely to

00:27:49.509 00:27:51.639
these sleepiness daytime sleepiness

00:27:52.399 00:27:55.180
problems drooling sexual symptoms so

00:27:55.879 00:27:58.690
this is all new I went to the first

00:27:59.120 00:28:01.200
women in Parkinson's disease conference

00:28:02.259 00:28:04.810
I want to say three years ago now which

00:28:05.000 00:28:08.649
was amazing and that group of women are

00:28:09.080 00:28:10.570
training other women to be support group

00:28:10.970 00:28:12.700
leaders for women and they're trying to

00:28:12.919 00:28:15.940
establish research priorities for women

00:28:16.240 00:28:19.419
and gender research so I think that's a

00:28:19.669 00:28:21.369
huge contribution and ever since then

00:28:21.559 00:28:23.109
there's been so much more research come

00:28:23.269 00:28:24.940
out about the differences but

00:28:25.159 00:28:27.690
men and women in response to medication

00:28:28.700 00:28:31.470
exercise other things like that

00:28:32.480 00:28:34.870
hi again okay so let's start on the next

00:28:35.269 00:28:36.879
section which is more about the cause of

00:28:37.669 00:28:39.549
Parkinson disease so let me switch

00:28:47.350 00:28:49.120
screens all right a little bit of

00:28:49.909 00:28:51.519
neuroanatomy I just want you to have be

00:28:52.130 00:28:53.500
familiar with where the basal ganglia

00:28:54.230 00:28:56.620
are in the brain there's some cortical

00:28:57.200 00:29:00.190
structures so the gray you see around

00:29:00.440 00:29:04.509
the edge that is the cortex it's the

00:29:05.080 00:29:08.889
most outside this the area's lit up and

00:29:09.200 00:29:11.799
yellow green and colorful that are those

00:29:11.960 00:29:15.430
are different nuclei which is a group of

00:29:16.000 00:29:19.840
neurons all together and those represent

00:29:20.360 00:29:22.029
the basal ganglia at different parts of

00:29:22.159 00:29:24.850
the basal ganglia the port the part

00:29:25.070 00:29:26.620
there that it's black is called the

00:29:27.950 00:29:29.350
substantial and that is where the

00:29:29.899 00:29:33.940
dopamine neurons live that's called the

00:29:34.990 00:29:38.970
midbrain and the reason it's black and

00:29:39.980 00:29:42.220
labeled substantia is because

00:29:42.950 00:29:45.970
dopamine neurons are always associated

00:29:46.610 00:29:49.450
with pigment or melanin and so that part

00:29:49.490 00:29:53.560
of the brain is black in color and it

00:29:53.840 00:29:56.190
turns out that probably that pigment may

00:29:57.200 00:30:00.340
play a role and potentially contribute

00:30:00.529 00:30:02.080
to one of the causes of Parkinson

00:30:02.740 00:30:04.930
disease so you can see the white arrow

00:30:05.090 00:30:07.389
is going up from the substantia

00:30:07.760 00:30:09.460
where the dopamine cells are projecting

00:30:09.679 00:30:12.210
up to these different regions and

00:30:13.220 00:30:14.680
communicating with the cortex the higher

00:30:15.230 00:30:17.379
levels your cortex is what tells your

00:30:17.809 00:30:20.110
muscles what to do that this basal

00:30:20.539 00:30:24.940
ganglia is just simply it's like a it's

00:30:25.730 00:30:28.000
modifying those signals it's sort of

00:30:28.880 00:30:30.480
fine-tuning the signals to the muscles

00:30:31.490 00:30:33.850
the cortex is involved in voluntary

00:30:34.460 00:30:36.580
movement and everyday habitual movements

00:30:38.870 00:30:40.990
and all your yeah you know getting out

00:30:41.150 00:30:43.060
of car getting out of bed getting up

00:30:43.190 00:30:44.860
from the floor things you don't think

00:30:45.140 00:30:48.400
about it all that's what the basal

00:30:49.540 00:30:53.280
ganglia is specialized in controlling

00:30:54.290 00:30:57.490
there's also a white arrow going down

00:30:58.130 00:31:00.910
lower into the brainstem where these the

00:31:01.430 00:31:03.580
dopamine is also important because it's

00:31:03.950 00:31:07.570
related to the automaticity of walking

00:31:08.330 00:31:10.690
you're how to integrate your balance and

00:31:10.880 00:31:13.480
your trunk movements with your other arm

00:31:13.880 00:31:17.410
and leg movements gesturing breathing

00:31:17.690 00:31:19.180
eye movements all those little things

00:31:19.790 00:31:21.820
that happen spontaneously when we

00:31:22.610 00:31:25.690
communicate what I'm moving are no

00:31:26.060 00:31:28.180
longer as spontaneous and Parkinson

00:31:28.340 00:31:29.530
disease because there's a problem

00:31:30.410 00:31:31.930
regulating the forces and the signals

00:31:32.180 00:31:34.270
and the timing of the signals to the

00:31:34.870 00:31:38.770
muscles so those automatic things that

00:31:38.900 00:31:43.410
we do every day become more difficult

00:31:44.420 00:31:46.420
voluntary movement just one purposeful

00:31:46.880 00:31:49.120
movement just step or reach is not as

00:31:49.400 00:31:53.590
difficult as more complex everyday

00:31:54.110 00:31:57.690
movement so the more sequences the more

00:31:58.700 00:32:00.220
change that you change position and

00:32:00.590 00:32:03.490
space the more difficult those skills

00:32:03.770 00:32:07.650
are for people with Parkinson disease I

00:32:08.660 00:32:10.960
like to think about the basal ganglia

00:32:11.720 00:32:13.270
because the more I understand it the

00:32:13.520 00:32:14.770
more I can think about how can we

00:32:15.050 00:32:17.920
develop exercise programs to target the

00:32:18.220 00:32:20.230
specific pathways because we want you

00:32:21.050 00:32:25.030
right to activate these pathways as soon

00:32:25.220 00:32:28.240
as possible even though they're damaged

00:32:28.520 00:32:30.880
or they're not operating as efficient as

00:32:31.070 00:32:32.050
they should because they're lacking

00:32:32.960 00:32:35.190
dopamine doesn't mean they can't improve

00:32:36.200 00:32:38.380
their signaling and improve the strength

00:32:38.690 00:32:41.860
of these different pathways so there are

00:32:42.200 00:32:45.610
three different circuits that run

00:32:45.950 00:32:48.760
through the very same regions of the

00:32:49.000 00:32:51.940
brain one is involved in the motor so

00:32:51.980 00:32:54.460
I mean motor driving force regulation

00:32:54.799 00:32:57.820
through the limbs and that's responsible

00:32:57.980 00:32:59.610
for the symptoms of brady kinesia

00:33:00.620 00:33:01.840
rigidity and tremor

00:33:02.809 00:33:05.500
there's also cognitive circuits in

00:33:06.159 00:33:08.139
parallel through these same parts of the

00:33:08.240 00:33:10.240
brain involved in a problem-solving

00:33:11.059 00:33:12.159
high-level problem-solving which is

00:33:12.950 00:33:15.100
executive functioning being able to make

00:33:15.409 00:33:17.879
quick decisions when to go and to stop

00:33:18.889 00:33:20.230
inhibition inhibiting the noise and

00:33:20.870 00:33:22.149
distraction out there so you make the

00:33:22.450 00:33:25.240
right decision requires a lot of

00:33:25.519 00:33:27.519
attention and the bill ability to divide

00:33:27.799 00:33:29.379
your attention back and forth between

00:33:30.110 00:33:32.799
multiple tasks so that's what the role

00:33:32.840 00:33:34.779
of the cognitive circuits and Parkinson

00:33:34.940 00:33:38.139
disease do then there are also emotional

00:33:40.000 00:33:43.560
circuits related to reward and fun and

00:33:44.570 00:33:49.480
humor and creativity and this is really

00:33:49.820 00:33:52.330
what underlies the depression the apathy

00:33:52.580 00:33:56.460
and anxiety and Parkinson's disease and

00:33:57.470 00:34:01.269
so by having therapies and approaches

00:34:01.490 00:34:03.360
that target these different things so

00:34:04.370 00:34:07.120
physical high effort exercise can target

00:34:07.549 00:34:12.210
your motor circuits requiring people to

00:34:13.220 00:34:15.129
make quick decisions during exercise or

00:34:15.740 00:34:18.550
dual tasks or have to think and

00:34:19.520 00:34:20.530
problem-solve through different

00:34:21.349 00:34:22.510
environments with exercise is

00:34:23.480 00:34:24.879
challenging the cognitive aspects of

00:34:25.429 00:34:28.149
Parkinson disease and then the emotional

00:34:28.669 00:34:31.510
circuits are are involved in giving you

00:34:33.129 00:34:35.440
feedback reward making the task

00:34:36.260 00:34:39.849
important to you or fun so that you're

00:34:40.069 00:34:43.809
more engaged emotionally so it's really

00:34:44.480 00:34:45.730
important for us with an exercise

00:34:46.220 00:34:48.540
program to target high physical efforts

00:34:49.550 00:34:51.940
high cognitive engagement and emotional

00:34:52.129 00:34:54.609
engagement that's the secret that's the

00:34:54.829 00:35:00.079
art of a good exercise program

00:35:01.089 00:35:03.150
so if you could look in that part the

00:35:03.309 00:35:04.710
brain and the midbrain where the

00:35:05.530 00:35:08.640
substantial Niagra neurons live you

00:35:08.799 00:35:10.620
would see on the left this black

00:35:11.170 00:35:13.289
substance and that's where the dopamine

00:35:13.660 00:35:15.450
neurons are and someone that has a

00:35:16.000 00:35:17.370
healthy brain on the left

00:35:17.799 00:35:23.490
no Parkinson disease the the red the red

00:35:25.260 00:35:27.359
represents axons from those neurons

00:35:27.819 00:35:29.280
projecting up into the basal ganglia

00:35:29.890 00:35:32.430
where they release dopamine on the right

00:35:32.770 00:35:34.410
you see someone with Parkinson's disease

00:35:36.059 00:35:39.359
and again already at diagnosis fifty to

00:35:39.609 00:35:41.099
sixty percent of the cells in the

00:35:42.130 00:35:45.450
substantia have died at diagnosis

00:35:45.640 00:35:47.579
in this process of cell death may

00:35:48.250 00:35:50.460
precede the diagnosis by five to twenty

00:35:50.910 00:35:54.480
years at the same time those cells are

00:35:54.760 00:35:56.849
dying some of them are just sick and

00:35:57.130 00:35:59.190
maybe inefficient and perhaps they could

00:35:59.500 00:36:03.150
be rescued or work more efficiently with

00:36:03.190 00:36:05.280
the right kind of exercise or in the

00:36:05.470 00:36:08.690
future with a medication or supplement

00:36:09.930 00:36:12.660
and there is evidence that exercise can

00:36:12.700 00:36:15.270
actually help the sick neurons be more

00:36:15.790 00:36:18.690
efficient and work better and that might

00:36:19.480 00:36:21.180
but the process of using them and

00:36:21.670 00:36:22.920
keeping them functioning better may

00:36:23.109 00:36:27.299
actually slow the disease progression so

00:36:27.460 00:36:30.059
if you could look let me go back if you

00:36:30.220 00:36:31.470
could look at the Pugh Taemin and

00:36:31.780 00:36:34.130
caudate here and where those neurons are

00:36:35.140 00:36:37.650
projecting to and releasing dopamine you

00:36:37.809 00:36:42.329
can actually quantify with different

00:36:42.609 00:36:45.569
types of PET imaging F dope of pet or a

00:36:45.970 00:36:49.109
DAT scan and you can visualize the loss

00:36:49.390 00:36:51.900
of dopamine so you see a healthy control

00:36:52.059 00:36:55.250
on the left you see this bright yellow

00:36:56.260 00:36:58.890
representing the the amount of dopamine

00:36:59.349 00:37:01.680
that's in the area on the right you see

00:37:02.020 00:37:04.670
someone with Parkinson disease with a

00:37:05.680 00:37:09.180
significant probably a 7080 percent loss

00:37:09.670 00:37:11.490
of dopamine on the right side there

00:37:11.770 00:37:12.910
which represents

00:37:13.730 00:37:16.690
and perhaps a person more worsening of

00:37:16.819 00:37:18.489
the symptoms on the left side of the

00:37:18.710 00:37:22.210
body um whereas on the other side they

00:37:22.369 00:37:24.279
may not have motor symptoms yet because

00:37:24.499 00:37:26.019
there's not as much of a loss of

00:37:26.599 00:37:28.839
dopamine so that's one way of imaging

00:37:29.420 00:37:31.989
dopamine and again research it does is

00:37:32.690 00:37:35.229
expensive the dad scans are used often

00:37:35.630 00:37:38.069
by neurologists to rule out other

00:37:39.079 00:37:42.039
disease to try to really verify is this

00:37:42.230 00:37:45.579
a dope energic neurodegenerative disease

00:37:45.799 00:37:47.620
is it related to the dopamine system

00:37:48.230 00:37:49.870
because they can measure and see what

00:37:50.029 00:37:55.319
the effect is on the release dopamine

00:37:56.329 00:37:59.920
still unfortunately to truly diagnose

00:38:00.589 00:38:05.049
Parkinson disease you the pathological

00:38:05.660 00:38:08.529
hallmark of the disease is found by

00:38:09.019 00:38:11.079
doing autopsies on people that have died

00:38:11.509 00:38:13.690
and looking into the substantia

00:38:14.180 00:38:15.789
again on the left is one from someone

00:38:16.640 00:38:19.239
that was did not have Parkinson disease

00:38:19.730 00:38:22.329
you still see the pigment and if you

00:38:22.519 00:38:23.859
could look at a microscope you'd see a

00:38:23.960 00:38:26.920
lot of dopamine neurons on the right you

00:38:27.049 00:38:31.029
don't see any more pigment and if you

00:38:31.220 00:38:34.059
could look under a microscope you can

00:38:34.489 00:38:36.160
actually try to count the neurons that

00:38:36.710 00:38:39.640
were left and you'd also see a lot of

00:38:40.059 00:38:42.249
dead dopamine neurons that look like

00:38:43.869 00:38:47.130
this they swell up and there are these

00:38:48.140 00:38:51.249
sub these groups these balls these kind

00:38:51.730 00:38:56.529
of clumps inside that are round and it

00:38:56.839 00:38:59.400
turns out those are alpha-synuclein

00:39:00.410 00:39:01.720
aggregates and we'll talk more about

00:39:03.849 00:39:08.140
that they call this image of a neuron

00:39:08.509 00:39:10.870
like this a dopamine neuron with these

00:39:11.660 00:39:15.120
clumps inside of them Lewy bodies and

00:39:16.130 00:39:19.109
again this is a classic hallmark of

00:39:20.119 00:39:22.870
Parkinson disease and if they see this

00:39:23.329 00:39:26.620
post mortem that would be the final

00:39:27.079 00:39:30.969
cause of death or a confirmation of

00:39:31.549 00:39:37.029
definite Parkinson disease so what is

00:39:37.369 00:39:39.729
causing Parkinson's what are the factors

00:39:40.039 00:39:41.440
what are the real mechanisms that are

00:39:41.809 00:39:45.009
causing the neurons to die we're going

00:39:45.079 00:39:47.700
to talk about the fact there are now

00:39:48.710 00:39:50.769
genes that have been identified that are

00:39:51.349 00:39:54.130
associated with the symptoms of

00:39:54.380 00:39:56.950
Parkinson's and in some cases Parkinson

00:39:57.140 00:40:00.059
disease or parkinsonism

00:40:01.069 00:40:02.950
also there are definitely things in the

00:40:03.279 00:40:05.979
environment that cause Parkinson disease

00:40:07.329 00:40:09.370
and then there's this interesting

00:40:10.309 00:40:12.009
relationship between genes and the

00:40:12.049 00:40:15.029
environment that are we have

00:40:16.039 00:40:18.779
susceptibility genes that might make us

00:40:20.229 00:40:22.749
predisposed or more sensitive to

00:40:23.660 00:40:26.559
environmental toxins that say come

00:40:26.989 00:40:29.109
through your food and gut or through

00:40:29.450 00:40:32.339
your olfactory system and through

00:40:33.349 00:40:35.859
respiration and things that you might be

00:40:36.319 00:40:40.569
exposed to so it's not a simple solution

00:40:41.089 00:40:43.120
it's actually very complex multiple

00:40:43.430 00:40:46.209
causes it's multifactorial but it

00:40:46.430 00:40:48.729
definitely has relationship to aging

00:40:49.489 00:40:51.279
environmental toxins genetic factors and

00:40:51.799 00:40:53.349
this sort of environmental genetic

00:40:54.229 00:40:55.959
interactions as we through our lifestyle

00:40:56.599 00:40:58.599
what we're all exposed to and what we're

00:40:59.029 00:41:04.239
susceptible to genetically so as of 2012

00:41:04.729 00:41:06.759
there were more than 18 specific

00:41:07.460 00:41:10.029
chromosomal regions identified that were

00:41:10.369 00:41:12.400
related to risk of Parkinson disease or

00:41:12.440 00:41:16.089
a cause even now not all have been

00:41:16.640 00:41:20.019
confirmed to be causative they don't

00:41:20.299 00:41:22.390
necessarily know what they all do but

00:41:22.999 00:41:25.509
they're associated with people

00:41:26.390 00:41:29.729
individuals that had some parkinsonism

00:41:30.739 00:41:31.769
also they don't all have the same

00:41:32.779 00:41:34.269
inheritance pattern they could skip

00:41:34.519 00:41:35.979
generations and they could be in every

00:41:36.469 00:41:38.920
family member so they're they know that

00:41:39.109 00:41:41.090
there is this

00:41:42.100 00:41:44.700
effect that just because you have a gene

00:41:45.100 00:41:47.070
doesn't mean you're going to get

00:41:47.710 00:41:49.860
Parkinson disease and it may be a gene

00:41:50.140 00:41:56.250
that's more related to other factors in

00:41:56.440 00:42:01.620
the environment only 10% and let me just

00:42:01.810 00:42:04.200
say that those 18 chromosomal regions

00:42:05.200 00:42:07.530
have been labeled park 1 part 2 part 3

00:42:07.930 00:42:11.580
all the way through part 18 and there

00:42:11.710 00:42:14.070
may even be more now I can't keep up

00:42:14.110 00:42:17.900
with all of the research on this but

00:42:18.910 00:42:22.320
only 10% of the cases do report a

00:42:22.870 00:42:25.050
positive family history and so they've

00:42:25.090 00:42:28.860
been able to show that at least two of

00:42:30.030 00:42:32.970
these regions of chromosome are related

00:42:33.220 00:42:36.900
to two genes the SNC a or LR our K 2

00:42:37.480 00:42:40.370
that are autosomal dominant forms and

00:42:41.490 00:42:43.740
then several others I think I listed

00:42:44.050 00:42:46.620
four there are autosomal recessive forms

00:42:46.810 00:42:48.270
in people that have a positive family

00:42:49.980 00:42:53.490
history again these different forms the

00:42:53.950 00:42:57.380
parkin the pink one that DJ one ATP 1382

00:42:58.390 00:43:03.560
those are again associated with

00:43:04.570 00:43:07.020
different age of onset sometimes a

00:43:07.300 00:43:09.330
little bit of different symptoms so some

00:43:09.490 00:43:11.370
may have more cognitive components other

00:43:12.210 00:43:17.730
more tremor or gate so you know when you

00:43:17.770 00:43:19.650
think of how different every person is

00:43:19.930 00:43:21.900
with Parkinson disease it's really not a

00:43:22.540 00:43:24.270
surprise that there may be many

00:43:24.990 00:43:28.800
different genetic contributions to

00:43:29.380 00:43:30.990
Parkinson disease as well as

00:43:31.810 00:43:32.790
environmental that creates the

00:43:33.400 00:43:36.590
heterogeneity that we see in individuals

00:43:37.600 00:43:41.640
just because you have a genetic you have

00:43:41.830 00:43:44.460
a gene that's been labeled as a

00:43:45.010 00:43:47.910
Parkinson's gene does not mean that you

00:43:47.950 00:43:52.140
will get Parkinson disease but it is a

00:43:52.660 00:43:53.430
really good way to

00:43:53.800 00:43:56.130
studied people over time longitudinally

00:43:56.680 00:43:59.460
to see what does happen and so many

00:44:00.010 00:44:01.920
studies are trying to say follow people

00:44:02.109 00:44:07.170
with the lrr k2 because it is in every

00:44:07.660 00:44:09.540
family member would be expected to have

00:44:09.910 00:44:12.240
that gene so if you can follow them over

00:44:12.490 00:44:14.190
time and see who gets Parkinson disease

00:44:14.680 00:44:18.599
and try to understand what are the other

00:44:19.450 00:44:21.150
components that may have contributed to

00:44:21.190 00:44:24.290
that and also can there be early

00:44:25.300 00:44:29.460
proactive like disease modifying ways to

00:44:29.890 00:44:31.829
intervene like with exercise or

00:44:32.579 00:44:35.309
nutrition or lifestyle reducing stress

00:44:36.130 00:44:37.349
so those are probably going to be the

00:44:37.599 00:44:39.240
first individuals who will really be

00:44:39.819 00:44:43.680
candidates for these types of neuro

00:44:44.400 00:44:46.890
protective strategies and also they will

00:44:47.140 00:44:49.319
provide a really good way to understand

00:44:50.190 00:44:52.920
better they're trying to find biomarkers

00:44:53.740 00:44:55.650
say that these individuals have like do

00:44:55.780 00:44:58.410
they have constipation across over time

00:44:58.839 00:45:00.660
do they develop lots of smell and when

00:45:00.819 00:45:01.410
does that happen

00:45:02.170 00:45:05.520
do they have difficulties with sleep so

00:45:05.740 00:45:07.260
the more they can understand all these

00:45:07.510 00:45:10.589
other non-motor associated symptoms and

00:45:11.050 00:45:13.470
how they develop over time it will only

00:45:13.810 00:45:18.559
help in earlier diagnosis in the future

00:45:19.569 00:45:21.390
so this is an interesting figure from

00:45:21.760 00:45:24.270
this article that was published in 2017

00:45:25.210 00:45:26.640
showing on the left two risk factors for

00:45:27.460 00:45:33.660
Parkinson's and on the right protective

00:45:34.950 00:45:38.250
factors so the larger it is the more

00:45:39.220 00:45:42.510
evidence there is and so you see on the

00:45:42.760 00:45:45.210
left as a risk factor pesticides there's

00:45:46.060 00:45:47.880
definitely evidence for pesticides which

00:45:48.130 00:45:49.770
just raises other questions like what

00:45:49.900 00:45:51.630
about solvents and what about other

00:45:53.040 00:45:55.230
things that we may be exposed to

00:45:57.329 00:45:59.790
chemically dairy has been associated

00:46:00.339 00:46:02.250
with risk and for a lot of different

00:46:02.890 00:46:06.059
neurodegenerative diseases is it you

00:46:06.190 00:46:06.930
know something that

00:46:07.089 00:46:10.829
the in the soil in this in the food that

00:46:10.960 00:46:14.039
these animals are eating people with

00:46:14.619 00:46:15.809
Parkinson's have a greater risk of

00:46:15.970 00:46:20.490
getting melanoma and that relationship

00:46:20.799 00:46:23.700
of melanoma and again skin and pigment

00:46:24.420 00:46:27.000
with Parkinson disease is not is still

00:46:27.190 00:46:31.020
not well-established and why but because

00:46:31.059 00:46:32.970
people with Parkinson's have more

00:46:33.490 00:46:37.549
melanoma then that is a risk factor and

00:46:38.559 00:46:42.240
frequent head injuries traumatic brain

00:46:42.700 00:46:45.210
injury there there is some evidence that

00:46:45.490 00:46:49.770
that can contribute over time in terms

00:46:50.170 00:46:52.920
of protective factors I also mentioned

00:46:53.049 00:46:56.279
on the left as a risk factor this new

00:46:56.680 00:46:58.589
idea of your gut microbiomes and how we

00:46:58.900 00:47:02.430
all have a different distribution of

00:47:02.650 00:47:04.589
those in our bodies and that some people

00:47:05.079 00:47:06.930
may have micro biomes that are more

00:47:07.599 00:47:08.849
protective of certain things in the

00:47:09.400 00:47:12.150
environment than others and that could

00:47:12.279 00:47:14.190
be an entry point for toxins into the

00:47:14.619 00:47:18.720
nervous system so protective factors

00:47:19.359 00:47:20.519
smokey and I mentioned so there's a

00:47:20.859 00:47:22.890
study looking at nicotine patch that I

00:47:23.140 00:47:24.809
think is in a phase 3 clinical trial

00:47:25.480 00:47:26.609
we'll learn more about that at the

00:47:27.359 00:47:30.510
retreat caffeine yay is protective so

00:47:31.150 00:47:34.890
don't put down that coffee cup what is

00:47:35.079 00:47:36.359
it about caffeine they don't necessarily

00:47:37.000 00:47:38.880
know they're trying to identify it of

00:47:39.069 00:47:43.890
course to isolate it it's also

00:47:44.440 00:47:45.539
interesting that your eight levels and

00:47:45.819 00:47:49.819
people with parkinson's are low and

00:47:50.829 00:47:52.769
people with gout where the urate levels

00:47:52.930 00:47:55.319
are high have a lower probability of

00:47:55.630 00:47:57.269
getting Parkinson disease so this is

00:47:57.549 00:47:59.160
interesting and again there's a some

00:47:59.589 00:48:01.200
clinical trials going on looking at

00:48:02.170 00:48:04.049
monitoring urate levels and trying to

00:48:04.270 00:48:06.420
help increase the levels and people

00:48:07.390 00:48:09.240
newly diagnosed with Parkinson's to see

00:48:09.430 00:48:11.220
if that can slow the disease progression

00:48:11.940 00:48:13.950
by optimizing the urate levels

00:48:14.440 00:48:16.829
the secret is in optimizing the Irate

00:48:17.170 00:48:20.650
levels without creating gout

00:48:21.619 00:48:24.579
but it is looking really promising again

00:48:25.130 00:48:27.640
physical activity exercise protective

00:48:28.160 00:48:30.210
factors in anti-inflammatories

00:48:31.220 00:48:34.690
specifically ibuprofen seems to be

00:48:35.450 00:48:36.730
protective for neurodegenerative

00:48:37.339 00:48:38.920
diseases and Parkinson's disease and

00:48:39.589 00:48:42.549
then also calcium channel blockers so

00:48:42.890 00:48:45.010
there's a drug called this rapid in or

00:48:45.799 00:48:49.029
rapid eating and it seems like it is

00:48:49.460 00:48:52.440
really important to keep calcium

00:48:53.450 00:48:54.910
controlled in the nervous system so

00:48:55.280 00:48:57.099
usually it's not you can't accumulate a

00:48:57.319 00:48:59.020
lot of calcium either externally or

00:48:59.390 00:49:02.319
inside a cell without causing some sort

00:49:02.390 00:49:05.559
of toxicity or damage so these channel

00:49:06.549 00:49:10.240
blockers which are kind of constraining

00:49:10.819 00:49:11.829
calcium keeping it where it belongs

00:49:12.319 00:49:15.430
might be important they also all of

00:49:15.740 00:49:17.559
these protective factors open up the

00:49:18.260 00:49:21.809
door for nutrition and supplements

00:49:22.819 00:49:23.670
antioxidants anti-inflammatories

00:49:24.680 00:49:27.370
nicotine patch that a lot of research is

00:49:27.500 00:49:28.720
going on in this and this is a great

00:49:29.059 00:49:30.460
review article if you're interested in

00:49:30.890 00:49:39.400
this area so my favorite figure I didn't

00:49:39.589 00:49:41.470
make this interactive so just ignore the

00:49:42.020 00:49:45.099
exercise words for now but there are

00:49:45.470 00:49:47.410
several different mechanisms that are

00:49:48.140 00:49:50.650
thought to really trigger cell death and

00:49:50.750 00:49:54.010
of course if you can stop that mechanism

00:49:54.529 00:49:55.240
from happening

00:49:55.490 00:49:57.579
you have a potential cure or a way to

00:49:58.099 00:50:00.069
stop or halt the disease which would be

00:50:01.510 00:50:04.900
neuroprotective so at the top you see

00:50:05.690 00:50:06.900
deficient neuro trophic support

00:50:07.910 00:50:10.059
neurotrophins are essential

00:50:10.670 00:50:12.630
they're the Gatorades of the brain and

00:50:13.750 00:50:15.849
they're specific to different neurons

00:50:16.250 00:50:19.210
and the dopamine neurons particularly

00:50:19.460 00:50:23.440
loved one called g DN f or BDNF and

00:50:24.440 00:50:27.779
these neurotropic factors help cells

00:50:28.789 00:50:33.519
operate smoothly efficiently reduce the

00:50:34.550 00:50:37.720
us oxidative stress inside the cells and

00:50:38.730 00:50:40.220
actually it's responsible for the

00:50:40.980 00:50:42.680
survival of the cells so to stay alive

00:50:42.720 00:50:44.830
and do all this work they do every day

00:50:45.840 00:50:50.770
making proteins destroying and proteins

00:50:51.780 00:50:53.570
they need a lot of food and substance

00:50:53.730 00:50:54.860
and that's what the neuro trophic

00:50:55.320 00:50:57.140
support is people with Parkinson disease

00:50:57.660 00:51:01.550
have low neurotrophins when you measure

00:51:01.920 00:51:08.000
those two neurotrophic factors let's go

00:51:08.070 00:51:10.610
to mitochondrial dysfunction so your

00:51:11.460 00:51:13.160
mitochondria are really your energy

00:51:14.130 00:51:16.550
storehouses in a cell every single cell

00:51:16.860 00:51:19.040
has mitochondria this is where they make

00:51:19.640 00:51:23.720
ATP this is the it's a machinery inside

00:51:24.180 00:51:26.090
the cell that does a lot of like

00:51:26.930 00:51:29.030
industrial factories stuff that you've

00:51:29.220 00:51:31.100
got to keep it it's a mitochondria gets

00:51:31.440 00:51:33.710
sick then that could cause create havoc

00:51:34.110 00:51:36.220
and toxicity inside the cell and

00:51:37.230 00:51:39.530
unfortunately the mitochondria are not

00:51:40.230 00:51:41.180
functioning well in people with

00:51:41.700 00:51:42.650
Parkinson disease and this is not just

00:51:42.960 00:51:45.790
in the brain but also in the muscles and

00:51:46.800 00:51:48.800
the cells can actually go into an energy

00:51:49.440 00:51:51.850
crisis and I think if this is sort of

00:51:52.860 00:51:54.070
perhaps the mechanism that underlies

00:51:55.080 00:51:57.140
fatigue if your cells are not getting

00:51:57.420 00:51:59.750
enough ATP they can't work efficiently

00:52:00.450 00:52:03.830
they wear themselves out and it makes me

00:52:04.110 00:52:05.540
think of the fatigue that people with

00:52:06.120 00:52:11.630
Parkinson's have another mechanism is

00:52:12.210 00:52:16.480
called oxidative stress and anytime you

00:52:17.490 00:52:19.100
this is happening like when a cell is

00:52:19.530 00:52:21.530
making a neurotransmitter they have to

00:52:21.690 00:52:23.570
make a lot of neurotransmitter and send

00:52:23.700 00:52:26.390
it out down into the synapse there

00:52:26.820 00:52:28.190
create they're mixing chemicals they're

00:52:28.770 00:52:31.450
creating things taking destroying things

00:52:32.460 00:52:35.210
little chemistry labs and there can be

00:52:35.400 00:52:37.640
the potential for oxidative stress and

00:52:38.460 00:52:40.580
you know I mentioned that dopamine

00:52:40.980 00:52:47.600
neurons are associated with melanin or

00:52:48.240 00:52:50.570
and it turns out that when dopamine

00:52:50.910 00:52:54.820
neurons make don't mean it's a very

00:52:55.830 00:52:58.940
highly oxidative process and there can

00:52:58.980 00:53:01.490
be damage and interaction with pigment

00:53:02.010 00:53:04.520
if it's not going well and so cells that

00:53:04.710 00:53:07.910
make dopamine me that may be one reason

00:53:08.460 00:53:10.070
they're predisposed to getting sick

00:53:10.770 00:53:12.350
because they're right in the vicinity

00:53:13.290 00:53:16.700
there are cells with pigment and so the

00:53:17.070 00:53:19.040
level of oxidative stress can be high

00:53:19.950 00:53:23.420
and it is high substantia has high

00:53:23.760 00:53:26.120
levels of oxidative stress in people

00:53:26.250 00:53:30.830
with Parkinson disease um finally I want

00:53:30.900 00:53:32.750
to mention one of the other mechanisms

00:53:32.880 00:53:34.730
that is actually super interesting I'm

00:53:34.800 00:53:36.410
going to talk more about is the fact

00:53:36.540 00:53:40.640
that the cells actually you know every

00:53:40.890 00:53:44.540
cell has to make proteins so these are

00:53:45.060 00:53:46.730
critical elements that have jobs to do

00:53:47.130 00:53:49.780
inside the cells at the synapses

00:53:50.870 00:53:52.610
neurotransmitters but they also have

00:53:53.250 00:53:55.430
these proteins are only good for like 24

00:53:55.740 00:53:57.080
hours so they have to then go and

00:53:57.600 00:53:58.970
destroy those proteins and have a way to

00:53:59.250 00:54:01.460
get rid of them because an an old

00:54:02.130 00:54:04.930
protein is a toxic is toxic to the cell

00:54:05.940 00:54:09.010
so cells have a lot of different ways to

00:54:10.490 00:54:14.180
eliminate garbage garbage disposal

00:54:14.910 00:54:19.100
mechanisms and in Parkinson disease it

00:54:19.470 00:54:23.390
turns out that their garbage disposal

00:54:23.880 00:54:25.640
machinery is impaired and that this

00:54:26.490 00:54:28.310
specifically affects a protein called

00:54:28.740 00:54:30.970
alpha synuclein so the alpha synuclein

00:54:31.980 00:54:33.890
builds up inside the cell and in the

00:54:34.440 00:54:35.660
outside of the cell in the extracellular

00:54:36.180 00:54:39.020
space and it become it becomes toxic it

00:54:39.570 00:54:41.420
clumps and we'll talk about that so

00:54:42.330 00:54:45.260
anything that it can prove the garbage

00:54:45.470 00:54:47.300
disposal machinery in a cell could

00:54:48.230 00:54:50.540
potentially keep the cells alive longer

00:54:51.230 00:54:53.750
and it turns out there's already a lot

00:54:53.790 00:54:56.330
of medications for that for other types

00:54:56.550 00:55:00.260
of diseases cancer for instance there's

00:55:00.360 00:55:01.309
a lot of reasons

00:55:01.559 00:55:03.499
why a cell needs to have garbage

00:55:04.349 00:55:06.920
disposals and so other diseases have

00:55:07.920 00:55:09.709
developed drugs for that so some of

00:55:09.959 00:55:11.599
those drugs may be helpful for people

00:55:12.059 00:55:15.229
with Parkinson disease so the bottom

00:55:15.269 00:55:17.089
line is you have all these mechanisms

00:55:17.459 00:55:19.339
and it's not very clear which comes

00:55:19.680 00:55:22.699
first and in fact it may be that

00:55:23.459 00:55:25.729
oxidative stress happens first and that

00:55:26.359 00:55:28.160
triggers problems with the garbage

00:55:28.949 00:55:30.559
disposals and then that affects the

00:55:31.469 00:55:32.599
mitochondrial function or the other way

00:55:33.029 00:55:35.870
around or perhaps in different types of

00:55:36.449 00:55:39.109
Parkinson disease subtypes people these

00:55:39.839 00:55:42.380
mechanisms may shift and be prioritized

00:55:42.900 00:55:44.959
differently so it's not a really clean

00:55:45.660 00:55:47.180
but if you can help with one of these

00:55:47.910 00:55:50.809
mechanisms you may be able to help slow

00:55:51.329 00:55:53.709
cell death which would be evidence for

00:55:54.719 00:55:56.269
it would be a disease modifying

00:55:57.109 00:55:59.930
treatment it may not be protection but

00:56:00.089 00:56:02.589
you're actually slowing the cell death

00:56:04.190 00:56:07.870
and then I have up there in blue

00:56:08.880 00:56:10.519
exercise so start with neuro trophic

00:56:10.759 00:56:12.829
factors exercise has been shown in

00:56:13.229 00:56:15.529
animals and humans to promote neuro

00:56:16.109 00:56:18.589
trophic factors specifically BDNF and

00:56:19.469 00:56:21.559
that's a really great thing so that

00:56:21.930 00:56:23.959
could provide more trophic support for

00:56:24.089 00:56:26.449
those sick vulnerable neurons that's one

00:56:26.670 00:56:29.209
reason exercise may help so much to

00:56:30.089 00:56:32.660
exercise can improve the energy

00:56:33.269 00:56:34.549
production in a Cell

00:56:36.109 00:56:38.390
and that has been shown that after

00:56:39.390 00:56:41.059
exercise the mitochondria both in the

00:56:41.339 00:56:45.199
brain and in the muscles is improved so

00:56:45.930 00:56:48.140
you get more energy you get more ATP the

00:56:48.420 00:56:51.049
cells stay alive and work harder more

00:56:51.719 00:56:55.249
efficiently for longer third exercise

00:56:55.469 00:56:59.209
has been shown to help reduce oxidative

00:56:59.749 00:57:02.900
stress so I can't you know there you go

00:57:03.269 00:57:05.239
there's three different ways exercise

00:57:05.640 00:57:10.099
can help with different mechanisms and I

00:57:10.259 00:57:12.630
also put on the far right there's other

00:57:12.760 00:57:16.740
types of potential protective or slow

00:57:18.329 00:57:20.099
disease-modifying things out there they

00:57:20.170 00:57:21.509
were being researched that will talk

00:57:21.700 00:57:23.460
about its retreat for instance nutrition

00:57:23.619 00:57:26.130
and supplements creatine is a supplement

00:57:26.529 00:57:28.319
and it can improve mitochondrial

00:57:29.220 00:57:31.500
function sleep sleep can reduce

00:57:32.170 00:57:34.650
oxidative stress so and sleep is a major

00:57:35.589 00:57:39.210
symptom a negative factor in Parkinson

00:57:39.450 00:57:42.269
disease meditation can also have a an

00:57:43.000 00:57:45.450
effect on stress management and in these

00:57:46.210 00:57:49.259
oxidative responses to stress on the

00:57:49.569 00:57:51.620
left in terms of the garbage disposal

00:57:52.630 00:57:54.269
there's a lot of new therapies like I

00:57:54.730 00:57:55.799
mentioned new medications that are

00:57:55.990 00:57:57.589
already fda-approved

00:57:58.599 00:58:01.650
vaccinations M if this is a sick protein

00:58:02.289 00:58:04.200
can you get the body to recognize it and

00:58:04.450 00:58:06.960
help eliminate it and get rid of it can

00:58:07.059 00:58:08.819
you do that through a vaccine or can you

00:58:09.010 00:58:10.559
also just do that through some other

00:58:11.319 00:58:13.349
mechanism helping the body fight this

00:58:13.930 00:58:16.249
toxic protein get rid of it clear it out

00:58:17.259 00:58:19.019
turns out and I'll talk about it at the

00:58:19.539 00:58:22.430
retreat that exercise actually improves

00:58:24.299 00:58:26.220
the elimination and helps to eliminate

00:58:26.859 00:58:28.769
the alpha-synuclein from both inside the

00:58:29.170 00:58:30.930
cell and outside in the extracellular

00:58:31.829 00:58:35.999
space so that's extremely promising and

00:58:36.849 00:58:38.309
although there are so many new things in

00:58:38.410 00:58:39.990
the pipeline therapies there is no

00:58:40.390 00:58:42.450
reason not to start exercising now so

00:58:43.089 00:58:44.249
get ready because we're gonna do a lot

00:58:44.289 00:58:48.660
of it at the Reese treat I just wanted

00:58:48.819 00:58:51.210
to see what is alpha synuclein because

00:58:51.339 00:58:53.099
this is new high you know ten years ago

00:58:53.410 00:58:55.109
we didn't know what alpha synuclein does

00:58:55.630 00:58:57.210
and they knew it was inside this Lewy

00:58:57.490 00:58:58.769
body but they didn't know like is that

00:58:59.559 00:59:00.690
causing the disease and it turns out

00:59:01.029 00:59:04.079
yeah I may be one cause so it's normally

00:59:04.359 00:59:05.880
present in the synapse so on the left

00:59:06.069 00:59:08.420
you see those little yellow particles

00:59:09.430 00:59:11.579
going in and outside the cell usually

00:59:11.890 00:59:14.849
it's recycled and it has a role in the

00:59:15.279 00:59:17.880
synapse and then you see what happens to

00:59:17.920 00:59:20.190
it as it becomes it's not getting

00:59:20.769 00:59:22.529
eliminated and it starts to build up

00:59:22.930 00:59:25.499
into these clumps and you can see on the

00:59:26.230 00:59:28.080
these misfolded proteins they start to

00:59:28.750 00:59:30.660
aggregate they have different names and

00:59:30.850 00:59:33.270
as they start to change shape they

00:59:33.700 00:59:38.280
become toxic so at the top here you can

00:59:38.650 00:59:40.260
see the differences in the shapes of

00:59:40.420 00:59:42.420
these proteins they're a monomer a dimer

00:59:42.610 00:59:46.140
and oligomers fibril and aggregate those

00:59:46.420 00:59:48.570
are toxic forms especially the oleg

00:59:49.000 00:59:52.770
immers and you then can see that the

00:59:53.080 00:59:54.720
cells have lots of different garbage

00:59:55.450 00:59:57.090
disposals on the left you see one that

00:59:57.160 00:59:59.010
looks sort of typical you run it through

00:59:59.380 01:00:02.880
and it it eats it up there's another one

01:00:03.070 01:00:06.000
called Auto Fuji where it contains it

01:00:06.310 01:00:10.080
right and and eats different particles

01:00:10.330 01:00:12.300
up and then there's one that just

01:00:12.910 01:00:14.940
constrains it like a ball or you know

01:00:15.400 01:00:17.670
keeps it all together so it can't wander

01:00:17.950 01:00:19.859
around and damage things inside the cell

01:00:20.619 01:00:22.380
so the goal for Parkinson disease

01:00:22.930 01:00:24.720
research analysis determined can you

01:00:25.270 01:00:27.060
improve these clearance mechanisms can

01:00:27.190 01:00:29.550
you help the cell get rid of this bad

01:00:30.280 01:00:38.120
protein and and then there's one more

01:00:39.130 01:00:40.109
piece of information about

01:00:40.950 01:00:45.030
alpha-synuclein that is new and has a

01:00:45.580 01:00:47.370
huge impact on the cause of the disease

01:00:48.030 01:00:51.030
so not only do these proteins accumulate

01:00:51.640 01:00:53.430
inside the cell like you saw on the left

01:00:53.740 01:00:56.550
side of this figure but then you see how

01:00:56.770 01:00:58.950
it's traveling up that axon and it goes

01:00:59.230 01:01:01.410
to another synapse and then it

01:01:02.109 01:01:03.420
communicates with another cell and it's

01:01:03.910 01:01:06.690
released and the next cell takes up this

01:01:07.000 01:01:09.960
bad protein and it's just continuing to

01:01:10.540 01:01:12.240
infect the neuron or cell after cell

01:01:12.640 01:01:14.640
after cell as it moves through the

01:01:15.100 01:01:18.960
nervous system so this is called a

01:01:19.540 01:01:22.410
protein infection or it's similar to a

01:01:22.810 01:01:24.210
prion disease you might have heard that

01:01:24.640 01:01:30.990
word in the literature this concept was

01:01:31.240 01:01:35.910
first published in 2013 and so it kind

01:01:36.040 01:01:39.630
of explains why you know if you put

01:01:40.420 01:01:45.330
if you do tissue transfer or stem cell

01:01:47.440 01:01:49.620
you could put normal tissue inside the

01:01:49.900 01:01:52.670
brain or a spinal cord and it may become

01:01:53.680 01:01:56.070
sick with this alpha-synuclein protein

01:01:56.350 01:02:00.270
over time so there's this real need to

01:02:00.970 01:02:05.610
control the to clear and get rid of this

01:02:05.980 01:02:07.350
alpha synuclein and keep it from

01:02:07.590 01:02:13.590
infecting cell after cell so dr. Brock

01:02:14.050 01:02:17.190
who's a neuroanatomist and has been

01:02:17.350 01:02:21.720
doing research since early 2000s looking

01:02:21.880 01:02:26.160
at postmortem brains and identifying

01:02:27.570 01:02:30.390
that this alpha synuclein because

01:02:30.550 01:02:33.980
there's a marker for it seems to be

01:02:34.990 01:02:36.570
ascending the nervous system it may not

01:02:37.030 01:02:38.880
start in the brain it may actually be

01:02:39.370 01:02:42.890
starting lower down even into the gut

01:02:43.900 01:02:46.020
the heart other places and moving into

01:02:46.180 01:02:48.810
the nervous system and so on the left

01:02:49.540 01:02:54.240
there are these stages of illness you

01:02:54.430 01:02:57.380
could say where at first the primary

01:02:58.390 01:02:59.940
system that's affected is in the

01:03:00.990 01:03:03.030
brainstem which controls cardiac

01:03:03.580 01:03:07.110
function blood pressure sleep sense of

01:03:07.570 01:03:12.450
smell and then it's not until it gets to

01:03:12.490 01:03:15.120
the brach stages 3 &amp; 4 where you start

01:03:15.190 01:03:18.060
to see sleep and motor disturbances this

01:03:18.220 01:03:20.370
is when the first signs of say tremor or

01:03:20.800 01:03:24.390
brady kinesia may start and at that time

01:03:25.060 01:03:26.340
there's already been a lot of other

01:03:27.100 01:03:28.740
damage occurring at the lower levels in

01:03:28.960 01:03:31.590
the nervous system and over time it

01:03:31.900 01:03:34.110
begins to move up higher into the cortex

01:03:34.900 01:03:36.450
or you start to see more emotional and

01:03:36.720 01:03:38.820
cognitive disturbances so this

01:03:39.730 01:03:41.370
hypotheses of how Parkinson's disease

01:03:41.950 01:03:44.490
progresses is not really in the older

01:03:45.100 01:03:46.350
textbooks it's starting to be put in

01:03:46.540 01:03:50.820
there now but it has a whole new focus

01:03:51.430 01:03:53.460
right for the you know how to

01:03:53.710 01:03:55.410
treat Parkinson disease and what how

01:03:55.480 01:03:57.030
many years people have been living with

01:03:57.790 01:03:59.160
Parkinson disease by the time they get

01:03:59.230 01:04:01.589
to the stage of the disease where you

01:04:01.780 01:04:05.640
have motor symptoms and he anticipates

01:04:06.010 01:04:10.290
he was able to look at people who died

01:04:10.750 01:04:12.599
from Parkinson disease and then try to

01:04:13.390 01:04:15.839
put together this puzzle of in different

01:04:16.150 01:04:19.230
people after they are dead or some

01:04:19.420 01:04:21.000
people who weren't diagnosed even with

01:04:21.609 01:04:22.830
Parkinson disease he could see that they

01:04:23.080 01:04:25.080
already had alpha synuclein building up

01:04:25.420 01:04:27.630
in the brain stem and it hadn't gotten

01:04:27.910 01:04:29.580
to the point of the motor signs and

01:04:30.040 01:04:36.630
symptoms being prep occurring so what

01:04:36.790 01:04:40.290
that means is that the motor symptoms

01:04:40.510 01:04:42.359
that we all associate with Parkinson

01:04:42.490 01:04:44.460
disease are just the tip of the iceberg

01:04:45.310 01:04:47.220
that's what we see but all that stuff

01:04:47.740 01:04:49.230
underneath those are the other parts of

01:04:49.390 01:04:52.200
the brain that are that are already

01:04:53.109 01:04:54.480
impaired and that probably have been

01:04:54.790 01:04:58.790
through as much as 25 years and these

01:04:59.800 01:05:01.410
this part of the brain is involved in

01:05:01.630 01:05:03.150
lots of things to do with the autonomic

01:05:03.780 01:05:06.030
system sleep like I mentioned blood

01:05:06.430 01:05:10.500
pressure cardiac function emotional and

01:05:10.630 01:05:13.920
cognitive systems so the more people

01:05:14.710 01:05:17.280
understand these other symptoms that

01:05:17.830 01:05:22.079
aren't as visible at diagnosis the more

01:05:22.450 01:05:23.700
they'll be able to diagnose Parkinson's

01:05:26.190 01:05:29.280
sooner so in I went to the World

01:05:29.859 01:05:32.070
Parkinson Congress in 2016 and there was

01:05:32.109 01:05:33.780
a huge emphasis on the non-motor

01:05:33.880 01:05:38.640
symptoms and people are trying to look

01:05:38.710 01:05:40.910
for sleep early sleep disorders and

01:05:41.920 01:05:46.109
constipation and changes in cardiac

01:05:47.369 01:05:49.470
function anxiety things like this that

01:05:49.750 01:05:53.640
may be good biomarkers for tracking that

01:05:53.950 01:05:57.720
might show B so people could get

01:05:58.030 01:05:59.940
involved in other kinds of things like

01:06:00.580 01:06:04.560
exercise and medications it's really

01:06:05.109 01:06:06.480
important to talk to your doctors about

01:06:06.700 01:06:07.259
these because there

01:06:07.479 01:06:08.729
a lot of treatments that could help

01:06:08.949 01:06:10.649
these motor symptoms non-motor symptoms

01:06:11.259 01:06:13.229
and truthfully these are the biggest

01:06:13.989 01:06:17.639
barriers to people to exercise programs

01:06:18.189 01:06:20.279
so they participate in exercise but and

01:06:20.439 01:06:22.620
are able to really exercise with high

01:06:23.429 01:06:26.759
effort in the way we want people to this

01:06:26.949 01:06:28.889
is what keeps people from participating

01:06:29.169 01:06:30.689
in life and doing the things they love

01:06:31.380 01:06:33.870
so there are new questionnaires that are

01:06:34.059 01:06:36.779
out now and I think I have one at the

01:06:36.909 01:06:38.489
end to show you we'll definitely talk

01:06:38.559 01:06:40.469
about it if they're a treat because you

01:06:40.659 01:06:42.779
can fill it out year after year take it

01:06:42.939 01:06:44.609
to your doctor and it can really make in

01:06:44.799 01:06:46.079
that way you can be sure to get

01:06:46.479 01:06:48.299
referrals to the appropriate specialist

01:06:48.579 01:06:53.370
that can help you this kind of research

01:06:53.679 01:06:56.069
also suggests right that there perhaps

01:06:56.739 01:06:58.919
toxins out there that are somehow

01:06:59.199 01:07:00.870
affecting our gut making us more

01:07:01.059 01:07:06.259
susceptible to this disease process and

01:07:07.269 01:07:09.269
there's evidence that on the left that

01:07:09.909 01:07:12.779
our vagal nerves can actually that

01:07:13.299 01:07:15.479
innervate our gut that the

01:07:16.359 01:07:17.969
alpha-synuclein is coming from the gut

01:07:18.429 01:07:20.669
going up through the this sensory

01:07:20.769 01:07:22.889
afferent and entering the spinal cord

01:07:23.049 01:07:25.439
and moving up into the midbrain same

01:07:25.630 01:07:27.089
with the olfactory system there's

01:07:27.489 01:07:29.179
evidence that it moves in from that

01:07:30.189 01:07:34.769
process as well you can find alpha

01:07:35.079 01:07:36.299
synuclein and people living with

01:07:36.849 01:07:38.129
Parkinson disease and in post-mortem

01:07:38.459 01:07:42.059
tissue so again this might be places to

01:07:42.279 01:07:44.759
look for earlier diagnosis one of the

01:07:45.069 01:07:46.889
most promising are the submandibular

01:07:47.769 01:07:51.539
glands um perhaps in the future when

01:07:51.579 01:07:53.309
people get colonoscopies they will be

01:07:53.769 01:07:57.019
screened for alpha synuclein your skin

01:07:58.029 01:07:59.579
stomach other kind of places like that

01:08:02.789 01:08:06.029
so there are there's research going on

01:08:06.369 01:08:07.769
we're there it's called their brain body

01:08:08.380 01:08:10.589
banks and they study your you over the

01:08:10.839 01:08:13.079
course of your life they take tissue

01:08:13.269 01:08:15.209
samples they do brain imaging they do

01:08:15.579 01:08:19.529
neuro tests and imaging and then when

01:08:19.719 01:08:20.910
you die yours

01:08:21.069 01:08:23.760
years later they have they can identify

01:08:24.339 01:08:26.370
what the cause of death was and then

01:08:26.500 01:08:28.260
they can go back over time and look to

01:08:28.299 01:08:31.130
see it when did alpha-synuclein start

01:08:32.140 01:08:33.900
when did the changes in the brain begin

01:08:34.779 01:08:37.200
when did the non-motor cyst symptoms

01:08:38.310 01:08:40.950
begin so that's again studies that are

01:08:41.380 01:08:48.660
looking for biomarkers so this thing

01:08:48.910 01:08:50.640
about Parkinson disease beginning in the

01:08:51.759 01:08:55.530
actually in 1817 dr. Parkinson himself

01:08:56.020 01:08:59.010
reported that some patients and with the

01:08:59.529 01:09:01.019
condition he termed at that time as

01:09:01.509 01:09:03.510
shaking palsy experience constipation

01:09:04.179 01:09:06.470
and one of the cases he described

01:09:07.480 01:09:09.140
treating the gastrointestinal complaints

01:09:10.150 01:09:11.880
appeared to alleviate the movement

01:09:12.009 01:09:13.829
related problems associated with the

01:09:14.580 01:09:18.720
disease so he was already just from his

01:09:19.150 01:09:21.800
good observation skills and note-taking

01:09:22.810 01:09:28.140
recognizing that one constipation is at

01:09:28.600 01:09:30.990
making the symptoms worse and doing

01:09:31.540 01:09:32.849
treatments for that and may improve the

01:09:33.279 01:09:35.519
symptoms and he's recognizing that the

01:09:35.739 01:09:38.340
gut might have a real this constipation

01:09:38.469 01:09:42.269
we have a real B contributing or even a

01:09:42.520 01:09:45.479
cause in the disease today constipation

01:09:45.609 01:09:47.130
is one of the most common symptoms of

01:09:47.710 01:09:49.079
Parkinson's at diagnosis and it often

01:09:49.690 01:09:52.309
perceived the onset of motor symptoms

01:09:53.319 01:09:55.350
dr. Brock who we talked about the

01:09:56.140 01:09:57.120
neuroanatomist in Germany he was the

01:09:57.460 01:09:59.100
first to demonstrate the pathological

01:09:59.590 01:10:00.930
changes may appear may actually

01:10:01.600 01:10:03.030
originate in the gut and end in the

01:10:03.400 01:10:05.910
brain and it's interesting remember how

01:10:05.949 01:10:08.070
I said that the vagus nerve innervates

01:10:08.910 01:10:11.250
the intestines and they tracked this

01:10:11.860 01:10:13.470
alpha-synuclein going from the stomach

01:10:13.630 01:10:15.510
the lining of the stomach inside and up

01:10:16.239 01:10:18.479
through this nerve people that have that

01:10:18.790 01:10:21.140
nerve cut for specific types of

01:10:22.650 01:10:24.510
illnesses have a lower risk of

01:10:24.699 01:10:27.050
developing Parkinson's disease so

01:10:28.060 01:10:29.400
something about so that does seem like

01:10:29.620 01:10:32.970
it it is a entry point into the nervous

01:10:35.440 01:10:37.410
so at the retreat we're gonna have

01:10:37.900 01:10:39.300
speakers talk about gut health and

01:10:39.610 01:10:40.979
different way in new therapies and I

01:10:41.170 01:10:42.569
just wanted to give you an idea the good

01:10:42.849 01:10:45.839
news is there are a lot of ways that you

01:10:46.329 01:10:49.129
could help get rid of alpha-synuclein

01:10:50.139 01:10:52.189
one you could start with on the far left

01:10:53.199 01:10:55.260
with inside the cell nucleus you could

01:10:55.420 01:10:59.189
just prevent the manufacturing of

01:11:00.460 01:11:01.950
by messing around with the DNA and the

01:11:02.020 01:11:04.919
RNA sorts of interventions that hasn't

01:11:05.139 01:11:07.770
been done yet that I'm aware of but you

01:11:07.929 01:11:09.870
can also prevent it from miss folding

01:11:10.150 01:11:12.270
and keep it from building up and

01:11:13.060 01:11:15.479
aggregating that's number two it may

01:11:15.699 01:11:18.419
also be possible in number three to just

01:11:19.119 01:11:21.510
dispose of the alpha-synuclein inside

01:11:21.730 01:11:23.580
the cell and number four dispose of it

01:11:23.800 01:11:26.490
outside the cell and exercise has been

01:11:26.679 01:11:30.990
shown to do three and four the other

01:11:31.270 01:11:32.970
thing is you can just keep the protein

01:11:33.280 01:11:35.250
but from being spread into the next

01:11:35.860 01:11:38.970
neighboring and uninfected cells so

01:11:39.400 01:11:43.140
there are some medications on the market

01:11:44.139 01:11:46.140
one of them is affect can affect prevent

01:11:46.239 01:11:49.140
it from miss folding to begin with so it

01:11:50.099 01:11:52.859
often opens up a lot of different

01:11:53.170 01:11:54.649
possibilities for research

01:11:55.659 01:11:57.839
so to summarize alpha-synuclein and Lewy

01:11:58.270 01:12:00.990
bodies is the hallmark of Parkinson

01:12:01.150 01:12:02.609
disease but now we know it may spread

01:12:02.920 01:12:05.310
from cell to cell possibly from gut to

01:12:07.179 01:12:10.439
it's a Mis folded protein and it's

01:12:12.360 01:12:14.580
responsible you know it's somehow not

01:12:15.599 01:12:20.310
getting disposed of because this sort of

01:12:20.739 01:12:23.819
garbage disposal system is not operating

01:12:24.510 01:12:26.879
efficiently there are drugs being tested

01:12:27.040 01:12:29.310
in clinical trials that increase the

01:12:29.650 01:12:31.800
clearance and keep it from accumulating

01:12:32.349 01:12:34.319
in the nerve cells there are vaccines

01:12:34.869 01:12:36.750
and immunotherapies that may target the

01:12:37.329 01:12:39.569
misformed alpha-synuclein and get rid of

01:12:39.849 01:12:43.169
it and then exercise may clear alpha

01:12:43.480 01:12:46.560
synuclein and also exercise up regulates

01:12:46.840 01:12:48.040
other neuro protective

01:12:48.290 01:12:49.500
actors like the neuro trophic factors

01:12:50.510 01:12:52.600
stress which may help these cells

01:12:53.150 01:12:55.540
continue to operate better kind of

01:12:55.880 01:12:57.580
provides a background right for neural

01:12:57.830 01:13:01.300
health for brain health so if you want

01:13:01.460 01:13:03.910
more information one you can go to

01:13:04.400 01:13:05.710
clinical trials gov you'll have a

01:13:06.230 01:13:08.260
handout in your retreat manual about

01:13:09.080 01:13:12.490
this and more will be in dr. Nate

01:13:12.950 01:13:13.870
McMullen and I will be talking more

01:13:14.060 01:13:19.000
about this on Friday at the retreat so I

01:13:19.280 01:13:20.320
want to leave you with some really

01:13:21.020 01:13:24.160
legitimate therapeutic options related

01:13:24.200 01:13:27.070
to meds deep brain stimulation and more

01:13:27.680 01:13:32.830
about exercise so I hope you will you

01:13:32.930 01:13:37.150
will get a copy of this medication table

01:13:37.790 01:13:41.410
it's it's from PDF org on the Internet

01:13:42.070 01:13:44.320
I recommend you get the hospital alert

01:13:44.750 01:13:48.790
cards and medications to avoid um you

01:13:49.670 01:13:50.980
you know there's so many issues about

01:13:51.320 01:13:52.390
people uh Parkinson's going to the

01:13:52.760 01:13:57.520
urgent care or to the ER and one the

01:13:57.680 01:13:58.660
first thing that happens is they take

01:13:58.940 01:14:00.850
away your medications and you have

01:14:01.160 01:14:02.260
certain rights and so you need to be

01:14:02.480 01:14:03.970
aware of that and to they may give you

01:14:04.160 01:14:06.070
wrong medicines that can actually really

01:14:06.260 01:14:08.890
make your your disease you worse and it

01:14:09.350 01:14:11.260
become even life-threatening so it's

01:14:11.540 01:14:14.370
extremely important that you're prepared

01:14:15.380 01:14:17.530
there's a lot of different types of

01:14:18.320 01:14:20.260
medication dopaminergic medication

01:14:20.630 01:14:23.620
things that either starting from the top

01:14:24.620 01:14:28.590
mao-b inhibitors they actually help you

01:14:29.600 01:14:32.200
keep the dopamine in the synapse longer

01:14:32.480 01:14:34.590
so you use what dopamine you have better

01:14:35.600 01:14:37.270
you can actually just replace dopamine

01:14:37.460 01:14:40.690
by taking levodopa carbidopa you can

01:14:41.510 01:14:43.180
take something that mimics dopamine

01:14:43.400 01:14:49.600
which is an agonist you can the dopamine

01:14:49.760 01:14:52.710
that you're taking you can just help it

01:14:53.720 01:14:55.540
to get into the cell and stay where it's

01:14:57.610 01:15:00.790
needed amantadine is better Utley know

01:15:00.920 01:15:01.840
the exact mechanism

01:15:02.510 01:15:04.510
but it seems to increase the amount of

01:15:04.700 01:15:06.580
your own dopamine that you release and

01:15:07.160 01:15:12.340
it may block reuptake so it stays on the

01:15:12.890 01:15:14.560
synapse longer it also effects

01:15:15.440 01:15:16.780
acetylcholine so it's been shown to help

01:15:17.000 01:15:20.080
people with dyskinesia and then there

01:15:20.120 01:15:21.790
are other things like anticholinergics

01:15:22.130 01:15:23.260
which have a lot of other kinds of

01:15:23.980 01:15:26.350
problems with cognition and other side

01:15:26.720 01:15:27.730
effects but they can help with the

01:15:28.070 01:15:30.850
tremor and may help with dystonias so

01:15:31.580 01:15:32.560
I'm not going to go into any more detail

01:15:33.260 01:15:35.170
but you can get a hold a table it talks

01:15:35.300 01:15:36.790
about each of those and I reckon and

01:15:36.950 01:15:38.260
we'll have it at the retreat so it can

01:15:38.420 01:15:40.090
help you ask questions of the doctors

01:15:40.220 01:15:42.580
that are going to be there there are

01:15:43.040 01:15:44.860
certain side effects of medication that

01:15:45.140 01:15:48.490
you really want to understand meds these

01:15:48.980 01:15:50.290
dopamine meds they start to wear off

01:15:50.630 01:15:51.900
they should last around four hours

01:15:52.910 01:15:54.820
typically they may start to only work

01:15:55.040 01:15:57.490
two or three hours sometimes they may

01:15:57.860 01:16:01.720
just go off unpredictably or maybe you

01:16:01.970 01:16:05.620
do predict it but and then they come

01:16:05.660 01:16:09.040
back on again so that's called an on/off

01:16:09.770 01:16:11.410
phenomenon sometimes it takes them a

01:16:11.450 01:16:12.340
while to kick in

01:16:12.890 01:16:15.430
so these delayed on responses some

01:16:15.710 01:16:17.860
people begin to develop the involuntary

01:16:18.380 01:16:21.070
movement so you might you might feel

01:16:21.110 01:16:22.900
good and you might not even notice that

01:16:23.060 01:16:27.400
you're having these dyskinesias but it's

01:16:27.890 01:16:29.350
important to track those when they start

01:16:29.570 01:16:31.000
and at what time of day because there

01:16:31.160 01:16:32.650
are things a doctor can do to optimize

01:16:33.410 01:16:36.460
that and perhaps reduce them and it's

01:16:37.120 01:16:39.550
very important because the dyskinesias

01:16:39.980 01:16:41.550
can really interfere with your fatigue

01:16:42.560 01:16:44.440
your whole lifestyle

01:16:44.750 01:16:48.820
it makes exercise hard balance hard and

01:16:49.100 01:16:51.520
then there's a few new things like

01:16:52.310 01:16:56.290
protein related off periods so if you

01:16:56.690 01:17:00.240
happen to be a highly dense protein mill

01:17:01.250 01:17:02.680
same time you take your medication

01:17:03.080 01:17:04.900
you're not going to absorb as much of

01:17:05.030 01:17:09.510
the medication and so these amino acids

01:17:10.520 01:17:12.910
interfere turns out that plant proteins

01:17:13.340 01:17:15.160
don't have quite the

01:17:15.770 01:17:18.340
effect on absorption perhaps because of

01:17:18.500 01:17:21.550
the large amount of fiber but again we

01:17:21.710 01:17:23.530
can talk to the nutritionist about that

01:17:23.690 01:17:26.050
at the retreat but it's really important

01:17:26.240 01:17:28.630
if you really want to be routine take

01:17:28.790 01:17:31.930
your medications to help them last as

01:17:32.180 01:17:35.080
long as they can optimally you really

01:17:35.270 01:17:37.780
want to be aware of this protein the

01:17:38.090 01:17:41.430
idea of what you're eating and when

01:17:42.440 01:17:44.650
other things that can really interfere

01:17:44.960 01:17:46.960
with quality of life or some of the

01:17:47.510 01:17:49.480
dopamine agonists create these impulse

01:17:49.820 01:17:52.320
control disorders where people develop

01:17:53.330 01:17:56.050
compulsive gambling hypersexuality binge

01:17:57.710 01:17:59.260
compulsive shopping online at night from

01:17:59.600 01:18:03.220
beads to clothes to purses whatever it

01:18:03.440 01:18:07.200
can be very very subtle to an all-out

01:18:08.290 01:18:10.960
this behavior that can destroy a family

01:18:11.750 01:18:13.750
so it's really really important that

01:18:14.180 01:18:15.670
someone that you know when you take a

01:18:16.160 01:18:20.170
dopamine agonist what to look for then

01:18:20.390 01:18:21.910
there's this idea that dopamine is

01:18:22.190 01:18:24.070
really an addictive drug right and

01:18:25.040 01:18:26.710
there's a lot more of these short-acting

01:18:27.470 01:18:28.510
dopamine medications they're called

01:18:29.030 01:18:31.420
rescue drugs for you you know instead of

01:18:31.790 01:18:34.540
taking them orally and you can give

01:18:34.910 01:18:36.610
yourself an injection perhaps inhale

01:18:37.280 01:18:40.540
dopamine and it can become very easy to

01:18:41.020 01:18:43.600
teat these frequently maybe too

01:18:44.210 01:18:45.700
frequently and it can impair

01:18:46.490 01:18:48.300
decision-making and social interactions

01:18:49.310 01:18:51.970
ability to work and carry on daily day

01:18:52.040 01:18:55.900
to day routines and the behavioral

01:18:55.940 01:18:58.320
changes can be quite dramatic and that

01:18:59.330 01:19:02.460
it's almost like instead of focusing on

01:19:03.470 01:19:04.900
quality right people become obsessed

01:19:05.360 01:19:07.030
thinking about their next medication and

01:19:07.280 01:19:10.180
when they need it so it's just something

01:19:10.280 01:19:11.950
to be aware of and talk to the doctor

01:19:11.990 01:19:14.560
about and it was not even considered

01:19:15.350 01:19:19.110
probably ten years ago as a problem so

01:19:20.120 01:19:22.210
it takes a partnership to optimize your

01:19:22.850 01:19:24.280
medication it's complex no

01:19:25.720 01:19:27.490
one-size-fits-all the best thing you can

01:19:27.650 01:19:28.870
do is to find a movement is

01:19:29.810 01:19:31.080
neurologist and I would say a

01:19:32.090 01:19:33.310
Parkinson's specialized physical

01:19:34.040 01:19:36.129
therapist for best outcomes so studies

01:19:36.350 01:19:37.840
have shown that people that see these

01:19:38.270 01:19:40.810
two specialists have lower rate rates of

01:19:41.239 01:19:42.640
admission to nursing home lower rates of

01:19:42.830 01:19:45.939
hip fracture improved survival you want

01:19:46.250 01:19:48.040
someone that will focus on you and your

01:19:48.500 01:19:50.350
quality of life get second opinions

01:19:51.110 01:19:53.370
stick with a routine and the dosage be

01:19:54.380 01:19:56.620
do it right don't take it for granted

01:19:57.199 01:20:00.459
don't just take it when you want the

01:20:01.219 01:20:03.430
medication changes they may be required

01:20:04.070 01:20:05.950
if your symptoms or side effects are new

01:20:06.110 01:20:07.300
or different or if they're not working

01:20:07.730 01:20:10.419
anymore but I highly recommend you try

01:20:11.000 01:20:14.129
first sticking to a routine try exercise

01:20:15.139 01:20:17.649
because you research shows people that

01:20:17.870 01:20:21.340
exercise vigorously over time with these

01:20:21.949 01:20:24.250
intensive bouts have a lower need for

01:20:24.949 01:20:27.490
medication from visit to visit and you

01:20:27.590 01:20:29.050
know just because you go see your doctor

01:20:29.449 01:20:31.149
does that mean you have to take and get

01:20:31.190 01:20:34.479
a different prescription for medicine so

01:20:35.480 01:20:37.990
you know don't go with just whatever you

01:20:38.120 01:20:39.669
know somebody says you you know and

01:20:39.889 01:20:41.530
gives you more meds say why what is this

01:20:41.719 01:20:43.390
gonna help me with can I not manage us

01:20:43.639 01:20:47.500
some other way so ask questions you're

01:20:47.630 01:20:48.669
gonna have to have this ongoing

01:20:49.280 01:20:50.530
conversation throughout the course of

01:20:50.630 01:20:52.149
the disease there's new meds all the

01:20:52.400 01:20:53.890
time you want to know the latest you

01:20:54.110 01:20:55.300
want a doctor who's going to share that

01:20:55.639 01:20:59.830
information and educate you so I hope

01:20:59.960 01:21:01.180
you can find a movement disorders in

01:21:01.310 01:21:03.129
your area if not it's worth traveling

01:21:03.290 01:21:06.070
even minutes just once a year um my

01:21:06.260 01:21:08.080
favorite movement disorders is online

Parkinson's he has books he writes for

01:21:17.540 01:21:18.879
the primary care and the general

01:21:20.449 01:21:23.050

with Parkinson disease he has a very

01:21:38.630 01:21:41.950
simple approach and he recommends you

01:21:42.199 01:21:42.700
should be

01:21:42.980 01:21:44.830
totally medicated as soon as possible

01:21:45.020 01:21:47.700
and stick with that medication and

01:21:48.710 01:21:55.000
exercise vigorously so he is you know if

01:21:55.100 01:21:56.860
you really want more information than

01:21:57.050 01:21:59.170
the article I'd recommend the book or

01:21:59.300 01:22:01.180
its partner partnering with your doctor

01:22:01.400 01:22:02.920
to get the most from your medication

01:22:03.620 01:22:05.740
take those papers to your physicians

01:22:05.900 01:22:09.940
they may not know about this optimal

01:22:10.640 01:22:11.610
medications mean you can participate

01:22:12.620 01:22:16.030
optimally in exercise so that's the main

01:22:16.550 01:22:18.400
reason to take medication and that's dr.

01:22:18.710 01:22:20.920
oz Coggs philosophy I mean it's

01:22:21.469 01:22:23.260
important that your symptoms aren't

01:22:23.660 01:22:26.229
controlled which is the typical view but

01:22:26.960 01:22:28.600
it's more important even that you

01:22:29.180 01:22:30.850
continue to do fitness and be involved

01:22:31.250 01:22:33.070
and fitness and exercise and stay fully

01:22:33.200 01:22:35.680
engaged in life you want to continue are

01:22:35.840 01:22:37.690
you doing what you love

01:22:38.060 01:22:39.820
are you reinforcing the dopamine circuit

01:22:40.760 01:22:42.310
tree through targeted parkinson's

01:22:42.920 01:22:44.890
specific practice we're gonna use

01:22:45.590 01:22:47.229
functional fitness as a way to target

01:22:47.750 01:22:51.360
brady kinesia you need to avoid

01:22:52.370 01:22:54.670
inactivity and be aware of it you come

01:22:54.800 01:22:56.620
home from exercise and you said and you

01:22:56.750 01:22:58.390
do nothing else for the rest of the day

01:22:59.030 01:23:02.229
it's so difficult to reverse disability

01:23:02.420 01:23:05.320
and loss of physical capacity or range

01:23:05.510 01:23:12.070
of motion so you need to continue to

01:23:12.260 01:23:14.370
move and have other and do things and

01:23:15.380 01:23:16.330
participate in other activities that

01:23:16.520 01:23:17.979
maybe you stopped doing and go back and

01:23:18.080 01:23:20.410
try them again and you need to

01:23:21.050 01:23:21.970
participate with vigor and you need to

01:23:22.280 01:23:24.580
feel like participating with vigor so

01:23:24.830 01:23:26.110
that's one of the key things I look

01:23:26.480 01:23:27.610
forward to give me a sense of as a

01:23:28.100 01:23:29.920
person optimally medicated can they

01:23:30.739 01:23:33.550
completely activate their muscles with

01:23:34.219 01:23:38.770
speed and amplitude the study was done

01:23:39.050 01:23:42.550
on a people newly diagnosed and they

01:23:42.800 01:23:44.440
gave everyone a questionnaire to look at

01:23:44.930 01:23:47.500
quality of life I had a lot of different

01:23:48.050 01:23:49.870
dimensions but you see on the left the

01:23:50.150 01:23:52.560
drug naive patients sixty-one of them

01:23:53.570 01:23:55.180
and every time they came in over the

01:23:55.400 01:23:56.470
course of a year and a half

01:23:56.660 01:23:58.510
their quality of life was worsening

01:23:58.940 01:24:01.690
that's why that scores are higher the

01:24:02.540 01:24:04.210
individuals who at diagnosis were given

01:24:04.340 01:24:07.660
at least a want some type of dopamine

01:24:08.540 01:24:10.840
replacement levodopa dopamine agonist or

01:24:10.970 01:24:14.770
in an MAO ABI inhibitor showed a better

01:24:15.380 01:24:17.229
quality of life over time with really no

01:24:17.840 01:24:20.740
worsening so that's a huge indication of

01:24:20.930 01:24:22.960
how much change can happen quickly and

01:24:23.960 01:24:26.050
if your quality of life is worth is

01:24:26.600 01:24:27.700
worse you're not going to be

01:24:28.370 01:24:29.860
participating in life or exercise or

01:24:30.440 01:24:31.600
doing all the things that you need to do

01:24:31.730 01:24:36.280
is stay active there is evidence that

01:24:36.530 01:24:38.290
the earlier you start the better your

01:24:38.750 01:24:41.020
quality of life is but it's not too late

01:24:41.390 01:24:42.970
to get started that's why I like this

01:24:43.720 01:24:46.930
study this was from a database of 3,000

01:24:47.120 01:24:49.060
people with Parkinson's from the

01:24:49.520 01:24:50.979
National Parkinson's foundation centers

01:24:51.200 01:24:53.260
of excellence which are all over the US

01:24:53.300 01:24:56.050
and Canada and every time people went

01:24:56.239 01:24:58.030
they were asked to complete the quality

01:24:58.130 01:25:01.750
of life measurement and every year they

01:25:02.000 01:25:05.020
come back and do it again so if you see

01:25:05.150 01:25:07.150
on the left if they were an exerciser at

01:25:07.550 01:25:09.400
baseline and every year afterwards they

01:25:10.010 01:25:12.670
continued to exercise they have no

01:25:13.070 01:25:15.190
change their quality of life stayed good

01:25:15.739 01:25:17.800
so that score change from zero to one

01:25:18.140 01:25:20.110
point eight very minimal difference if

01:25:20.570 01:25:21.790
you look at the group that said no I

01:25:22.190 01:25:24.850
don't exercise I never want to and the

01:25:25.340 01:25:27.610
therapist couldn't talk him into it year

01:25:27.800 01:25:31.270
after year their scores increased to six

01:25:31.550 01:25:35.050
point two over two years so they were

01:25:35.390 01:25:37.450
doing worse on quality of life and then

01:25:37.550 01:25:39.280
you see in the middle those are the two

01:25:39.560 01:25:41.590
groups who they changed their minds over

01:25:41.870 01:25:45.510
the the two years and did start

01:25:46.520 01:25:49.030
exercising and they were able to kind of

01:25:49.310 01:25:51.070
catch up right they their scores were

01:25:51.290 01:25:53.380
not as low as the group that said no no

01:25:58.540 01:26:03.460
no all right couple more so when your

01:26:03.770 01:26:06.990
meds are optimized you can actually

01:26:08.000 01:26:10.359
produce more effort more vigor

01:26:11.090 01:26:13.620
exercise it increases your tolerance for

01:26:14.630 01:26:16.330
effort it makes it more you more willing

01:26:16.790 01:26:21.820
to work for a reward so that's one

01:26:22.219 01:26:23.229
reason you need to have your meds

01:26:23.840 01:26:25.030
optimized so you can again fully

01:26:25.849 01:26:28.450
participate and benefit this was the

01:26:28.699 01:26:30.490
first study ever to show that people

01:26:30.920 01:26:33.160
that participate in intensive bouts of

01:26:33.710 01:26:37.209
rehab once a year required less

01:26:38.409 01:26:40.330
medication so this is a group out of

01:26:40.849 01:26:43.120
Italy and they had people receive PT ot

01:26:43.460 01:26:46.120
and speech three hours a day five days a

01:26:46.489 01:26:49.240
week for a whole month and every year

01:26:49.400 01:26:50.169
they did it again

01:26:51.940 01:26:56.189
and so that's sixty hours per year of

01:26:57.199 01:26:59.350
intensive exercise that was Parkinson's

01:27:00.110 01:27:02.589
specific skilled targeting those

01:27:03.230 01:27:06.399
dopamine circuits aerobic exercise and

01:27:06.530 01:27:07.899
on the right you see that two years

01:27:08.080 01:27:10.540
later the bottom line represents the

01:27:10.790 01:27:12.300
group that had that it's called

01:27:13.310 01:27:17.430
multidisciplinary inter inter multi

01:27:18.460 01:27:21.510
disciplinary intensive rehab therapy and

01:27:22.520 01:27:24.220
that line represents how much total

01:27:24.920 01:27:26.290
dopamine replacement they were taking

01:27:26.750 01:27:27.970
compared to the control group what you

01:27:28.190 01:27:31.180
see is much higher so the doctor would

01:27:31.460 01:27:32.709
see them every time they did their

01:27:33.260 01:27:35.169
intensive therapy he would see them and

01:27:36.139 01:27:37.570
he'd say you're doing so good I don't

01:27:37.730 01:27:39.700
think you need more medication or maybe

01:27:39.860 01:27:41.080
I'm going to take you off a little bit

01:27:41.300 01:27:42.760
because you don't need it anymore your

01:27:42.949 01:27:45.310
work you're moving so well so yeah

01:27:46.070 01:27:48.189
partnership optimized meds optimized

01:27:48.920 01:27:52.660
exercise the best results so how do you

01:27:52.880 01:27:54.580
know if your medications are optimized

01:27:55.520 01:27:58.330
first quality of life how about your

01:27:58.849 01:28:00.760
energy your sleep patterns your pain

01:28:01.760 01:28:03.430
quality of your movements do you have

01:28:03.889 01:28:06.250
full range of motion can you fully

01:28:07.130 01:28:08.620
activate and get into your good posture

01:28:08.960 01:28:11.530
and use your spinal range of motion do

01:28:11.630 01:28:15.689
you have um cramping or involuntary

01:28:16.699 01:28:18.490
movements or hallucinations or greater

01:28:19.340 01:28:23.040
anxiety panic attacks freezing of gait

01:28:24.469 01:28:26.439
Beacher swallow those are the things you

01:28:26.689 01:28:28.750
want to talk to your doctor about and

01:28:29.449 01:28:31.059
you want to target them as soon as

01:28:31.699 01:28:33.520
possible don't let him continue try to

01:28:33.859 01:28:36.339
find a way to reduce them and find out

01:28:36.530 01:28:38.039
what you can do

01:28:39.049 01:28:41.500
so meds are not enough right to really

01:28:41.959 01:28:44.500
have optimal wellness an optimal

01:28:45.109 01:28:48.189
recovery the medications will help you

01:28:48.439 01:28:50.500
with your motor symptoms your rigidity

01:28:50.719 01:28:52.619
the brady kinesia the in coordination

01:28:53.629 01:28:55.750
but the medications will not help you

01:28:55.939 01:28:58.689
with your emotional symptoms anxiety the

01:28:59.329 01:29:01.919
problems making quick decisions the

01:29:03.039 01:29:05.489
sleep the blood pressure

01:29:06.729 01:29:09.099
however exercise has been shown to help

01:29:09.319 01:29:11.139
with emotional cognitive and autonomic

01:29:11.959 01:29:14.379
problems all these non-motor symptoms so

01:29:14.809 01:29:18.609
I I just hope you'll start with exercise

01:29:19.010 01:29:22.059
when those things happen there's this is

01:29:22.099 01:29:25.539
a review article that talks about how

01:29:26.089 01:29:28.389
exercise in Parkinson's disease can

01:29:29.119 01:29:31.539
target all of these different things if

01:29:32.479 01:29:34.629
you look at that list there are so many

01:29:34.879 01:29:35.770
things on there that people with

01:29:36.349 01:29:37.389
Parkinson's have they live with on a

01:29:37.489 01:29:39.939
regular basis and exercise has been

01:29:40.429 01:29:42.969
shown to help this article was written

01:29:43.280 01:29:44.679
by a group of movement disorders

01:29:45.639 01:29:49.089
specialists and they agreed that this is

01:29:49.489 01:29:51.069
why people with Parkinson's should be

01:29:51.409 01:29:54.059
involved in vigorous aerobic exercise

01:29:55.069 01:29:56.909
fatigue constipation improved sleep

01:29:57.919 01:30:00.099
better cognitive function so they've

01:30:00.679 01:30:01.719
tested all of these these were about

01:30:02.059 01:30:04.509
this was a they put all the studies

01:30:04.969 01:30:08.649
together and then summarized them this

01:30:08.809 01:30:10.779
is that questionnaire that you can get

01:30:11.030 01:30:12.849
online it's called the Parkinson disease

01:30:14.199 01:30:17.889
non-motor scale questionnaire in MS it

01:30:18.199 01:30:20.379
looks at 30 different symptoms and how

01:30:20.449 01:30:23.669
you just simply rate yes or no and

01:30:24.679 01:30:27.129
whether you have five of these or 15 of

01:30:27.349 01:30:30.789
them you need to track these symptoms be

01:30:31.099 01:30:32.859
aware of them talk to your doctor about

01:30:33.319 01:30:35.109
them get referrals there are community

01:30:35.839 01:30:37.480
resources there's pelvic floor therapist

01:30:38.180 01:30:40.180
that can help with urinary issues and

01:30:40.670 01:30:42.640
bowel and bladder and constipation and

01:30:42.800 01:30:45.010
there are there's acupuncture there's

01:30:45.260 01:30:49.990
lots of different things out there so I

01:30:50.810 01:30:52.510
made a list of questions we're going to

01:30:52.700 01:30:55.090
talk about him but you know you need to

01:30:55.130 01:30:58.210
have a way to start talking and open a

01:30:58.970 01:31:01.300
conversation with your physician so you

01:31:01.430 01:31:03.460
know you want to know when they say here

01:31:03.710 01:31:05.170
take this you want to talk about well

01:31:05.390 01:31:07.030
why am I taking it what symptom is it

01:31:07.400 01:31:08.680
helping with you what are my other

01:31:09.280 01:31:11.170
options how will I know if it's working

01:31:11.810 01:31:15.610
can I stop it how do I stop it are they

01:31:16.250 01:31:19.020
are they addictive how do I know if I'm

01:31:20.030 01:31:22.240
starting to take too much how long

01:31:22.670 01:31:24.280
should I expect it to work these are all

01:31:24.560 01:31:26.500
great questions and so hopefully you'll

01:31:27.140 01:31:28.330
you'll have this in a handout you could

01:31:28.520 01:31:31.900
take that to the doctor you can also go

01:31:31.940 01:31:34.060
to the Davis Finney foundation and they

01:31:34.190 01:31:36.670
have this amazing book I'm going to show

01:31:36.740 01:31:39.250
you and you can you can get it for free

01:31:39.560 01:31:42.250
they asked for a donation it's probably

01:31:42.350 01:31:44.320
the best book of all this information

01:31:44.480 01:31:46.900
I've ever seen they have worksheets in

01:31:47.120 01:31:49.240
their medication logs they have a way to

01:31:49.640 01:31:52.420
track your symptoms and checklist for

01:31:52.520 01:31:54.970
your doctor so every victory counts

01:31:55.640 01:31:57.850
manual that's the name of it Davis

01:31:58.220 01:32:01.420
Finney foundation he's he has a young

01:32:02.260 01:32:06.370
onset Parkinson disease individual he is

01:32:06.440 01:32:08.560
a pro cyclist and he's all about

01:32:08.900 01:32:11.170
wellness and exercise and this book

01:32:11.420 01:32:13.690
every victory counts is well worth the

01:32:13.820 01:32:17.830
effort to get and they'll mail it to you

01:32:18.140 01:32:19.720
so just a reminder you need a medication

01:32:20.120 01:32:21.940
log there's one in that manual you can

01:32:22.460 01:32:26.050
create your own and last I want to just

01:32:26.300 01:32:28.960
mention the deep brain stimulation is

01:32:29.420 01:32:31.240
another option for people and there's so

01:32:31.460 01:32:34.210
much improvement in the type of

01:32:35.060 01:32:36.130
stimulators that are available now on

01:32:36.260 01:32:38.710
the type of surgeries there are

01:32:39.230 01:32:40.330
surgeries where you're awake or you're

01:32:41.720 01:32:44.410
some of the stimulators are more focused

01:32:44.720 01:32:47.560
and can be directed and targeted better

01:32:47.810 01:32:51.820
than others different surgeons though

01:32:52.100 01:32:53.980
have not all learned the newer technique

01:32:54.260 01:32:56.080
so you need to sort of ask what what is

01:32:56.120 01:32:59.530
that their preference and why and what

01:32:59.570 01:33:01.990
is the process the most important thing

01:33:02.180 01:33:04.810
is if you're a good candidate for deep

01:33:05.030 01:33:07.390
brain stimulation then yes but you need

01:33:07.490 01:33:08.800
to go through ideally a

01:33:09.530 01:33:10.870
multidisciplinary team you need to be

01:33:11.270 01:33:13.030
assessed by a therapist a speech

01:33:13.730 01:33:15.340
therapist a psychologist psychiatrist

01:33:16.100 01:33:18.580
and a neurologist movement disorder

01:33:19.160 01:33:19.780
specialists and probably the

01:33:20.510 01:33:24.010
neurosurgeon you need a team because if

01:33:24.260 01:33:26.140
you aren't the right candidate it cannot

01:33:26.390 01:33:28.600
be a good positive thing and it is brain

01:33:29.450 01:33:31.480
I hope you've tried exercise before you

01:33:31.820 01:33:32.830
start that I hope you've been to rehab

01:33:33.170 01:33:35.410
and done intensive therapies those are

01:33:35.510 01:33:36.970
the kind of things I would recommend if

01:33:37.100 01:33:39.310
I was screening people for DBS I'd be

01:33:39.650 01:33:41.230
looking for do you have freezing do you

01:33:41.360 01:33:43.210
have trouble with speech and fluency do

01:33:43.280 01:33:45.430
you have problems with swallowing are

01:33:45.560 01:33:47.940
you having cognitive issues that are

01:33:48.950 01:33:50.830
that could be all all of those things

01:33:51.020 01:33:52.870
could get worse do you have problems

01:33:53.000 01:33:55.960
with balance and postural control could

01:33:56.180 01:33:59.920
get worse with DBS the best candidate

01:34:00.230 01:34:03.100
for DBS are those people that when they

01:34:03.410 01:34:05.050
take their medication their dopamine

01:34:05.990 01:34:09.160
medication they feel it it kicks if your

01:34:09.530 01:34:11.470
dopamine meds are working the best they

01:34:11.750 01:34:14.890
work is about as good as the deep brain

01:34:15.590 01:34:18.040
stimulator will do so when you're on

01:34:18.560 01:34:20.230
with your meds that gives you a good

01:34:20.270 01:34:23.020
idea of what a stimulator might do and

01:34:23.720 01:34:25.330
then you could sometimes take away the

01:34:26.060 01:34:27.790
medications or you can continue to add a

01:34:28.220 01:34:32.320
little bit people that have a tremor

01:34:32.720 01:34:34.900
that the deep brain stimulation really

01:34:35.210 01:34:35.890
helps with the termer

01:34:37.090 01:34:40.240
and for those people that have they

01:34:40.790 01:34:42.700
respond to the medication but it wears

01:34:43.010 01:34:44.830
off and they just can't find a way to

01:34:45.140 01:34:47.620
keep their medications constant over the

01:34:47.840 01:34:49.810
day and their help so they're having

01:34:50.020 01:34:52.620
these fluctuations and it's really in

01:34:53.630 01:34:55.150
impacting quality of life those

01:34:56.120 01:34:59.130
individuals are often good candidates so

01:35:00.140 01:35:02.710
um I recommend you go get second

01:35:03.260 01:35:05.330
opinions talk to other people in my

01:35:05.460 01:35:07.490
ever a place to go have people go is to

01:35:07.650 01:35:11.750
this DBS for PD org there at the bottom

01:35:12.389 01:35:14.359
that's a survey of thousands of people

01:35:14.580 01:35:16.459
who have had the deep brain stimulator

01:35:17.070 01:35:19.700
it's people with Parkinson's telling you

01:35:19.889 01:35:22.550
in a survey what it was like how it

01:35:22.800 01:35:24.770
feels what it seems to help with what

01:35:25.320 01:35:27.770
happens afterwards it's a great thing to

01:35:28.230 01:35:29.870
read before you make a decision or

01:35:30.510 01:35:31.820
before you start asking a lot of

01:35:32.340 01:35:35.180
questions so you know what to ask if you

01:35:35.340 01:35:36.620
just want to know about the surgery in

01:35:36.840 01:35:39.169
general and just general information go

01:35:39.210 01:35:41.000
to the National Parkinson's Association

01:35:41.190 01:35:43.490
they have most all of the association's

01:35:43.710 01:35:45.140
have information about deep brain

01:35:45.750 01:35:47.810
stimulation that's more technical but I

01:35:48.389 01:35:50.450
highly recommend that survey by the DBS

01:35:50.820 01:35:55.550
for PD org so it's time for new

01:35:56.130 01:35:58.609
paradigms in Parkinson's there's been

01:35:58.800 01:36:01.160
this problem but as a physical therapist

01:36:01.530 01:36:04.280
and in terms of exercise people never

01:36:04.679 01:36:06.709
get us they never get exercise until

01:36:06.840 01:36:09.560
they start to fall or have an injury so

01:36:09.599 01:36:12.620
that top bot line represents the stages

01:36:12.659 01:36:16.040
of Parkinson's from diagnosis where the

01:36:16.320 01:36:17.959
site the symptoms are on one side of the

01:36:18.179 01:36:20.390
body and then they by stage two they

01:36:20.699 01:36:22.520
start to go to the other side it's not

01:36:22.770 01:36:24.589
until people get to a stage three when

01:36:24.750 01:36:27.649
they're falling that we see them that's

01:36:28.080 01:36:31.070
years later and yes we can help at that

01:36:31.560 01:36:34.070
point but opt ideally we'd like to

01:36:34.650 01:36:36.709
prevent the Falls and put off that loss

01:36:37.170 01:36:39.200
that motor deterioration that's

01:36:39.810 01:36:41.600
happening so we need to start with

01:36:42.030 01:36:43.879
people at diagnosis and in the future

01:36:44.280 01:36:45.950
when there are more biomarkers I hope I

01:36:46.230 01:36:47.959
even get to start with people before

01:36:48.150 01:36:50.540
they have motor symptoms can we help

01:36:50.730 01:36:53.689
them start exercising even early early

01:36:54.060 01:36:58.070
before the symptoms you hear all this

01:36:58.139 01:37:01.359
talk about is exercise disease-modifying

01:37:02.369 01:37:04.970
can it slow the disease and my answer

01:37:05.130 01:37:07.189
would be with our current health care

01:37:07.889 01:37:10.910
paradigms know no matter what class you

01:37:11.130 01:37:14.870
do or how many times you go week one

01:37:15.270 01:37:17.300
class is not going to slow disease you

01:37:17.460 01:37:18.379
need to have acts

01:37:18.479 01:37:21.049
us to an ongoing exercise prescription

01:37:21.419 01:37:23.810
for life you need to have someone modify

01:37:24.059 01:37:26.209
that prescription then you also need to

01:37:26.369 01:37:28.699
have targeted practice and skilled

01:37:29.459 01:37:31.489
practice on specific issues across your

01:37:31.709 01:37:35.179
life with rehab ideally every six months

01:37:35.579 01:37:37.040
you need to be assessed with you know

01:37:37.110 01:37:39.169
you need to know what's going on and

01:37:39.570 01:37:41.750
it's an exercise prescription and it may

01:37:42.119 01:37:43.370
change over time just like your

01:37:45.199 01:37:47.600
medications that is how we're gonna slow

01:37:47.909 01:37:49.339
