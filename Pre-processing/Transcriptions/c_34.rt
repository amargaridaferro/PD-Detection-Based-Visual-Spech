welcome to this Arnold colorful knitwear

00:00:07.050 00:00:08.629
tutorial this is part of our year of

00:00:09.270 00:00:11.299
techniques 12 patterns to help you to

00:00:11.490 00:00:13.610
upgrade your knitting skills today I'm

00:00:13.800 00:00:17.359
going to show you the ways to hold your

00:00:17.400 00:00:20.420
yarn for fair isle patterns so that you

00:00:20.669 00:00:22.400
keep it really consistent and so that

00:00:22.529 00:00:24.350
your patterning really stands out from

00:00:24.509 00:00:26.510
the background so I'm working on this

00:00:27.029 00:00:28.819
mitten which has some yarn in it for an

00:00:29.399 00:00:32.450
afterthought thumb and the yellow is the

00:00:33.030 00:00:34.850
pattern or foreground color and the dark

00:00:35.219 00:00:38.240
gray is a background color and what we

00:00:38.490 00:00:40.130
want is for the yellow to really stand

00:00:40.320 00:00:42.650
out from the background and so we're

00:00:42.810 00:00:44.810
going to do that by always taking the

00:00:45.180 00:00:48.170
yellow yarn from below the gray yarn so

00:00:48.329 00:00:49.730
the gray will always go above and the

00:00:49.920 00:00:51.890
yellow will always go below what that

00:00:52.140 00:00:53.569
means is that because the yellow is

00:00:53.820 00:00:55.760
coming from below each of those stitches

00:00:56.040 00:00:58.550
are slightly longer than the dark gray

00:00:58.829 00:01:00.560
ones which makes it really stand out a

00:01:00.840 00:01:05.299
lot more so how do you hold your wool so

00:01:05.489 00:01:07.240
that you make sure that you're always

00:01:08.250 00:01:09.500
taking the yellow from below

00:01:09.810 00:01:12.230
well I hold my yarns both in my right

00:01:12.570 00:01:17.180
hand and I'm able to keep the background

00:01:17.430 00:01:19.070
color over the index finger and the

00:01:19.409 00:01:21.649
foreground color over my middle finger

00:01:21.870 00:01:25.219
and that means that I can flick the wool

00:01:25.970 00:01:28.490
over alternately because I'm on a

00:01:28.979 00:01:33.200
section of doing alternate stitches and

00:01:33.420 00:01:34.940
if you look closely you'll see that each

00:01:35.340 00:01:37.760
time the yellow is coming underneath the

00:01:41.299 00:01:43.580
gray and that keeps everything really

00:01:45.170 00:01:47.179
consistent not everybody holds their

00:01:47.490 00:01:49.490
yarn for same way around that I do many

00:01:49.770 00:01:51.859
people when they're working fair I like

00:01:52.110 00:01:55.670
to have one yarn over each hand and in

00:01:55.860 00:01:56.990
this case you'd have the background

00:01:57.600 00:01:59.000
color in your right hand and the

00:01:59.280 00:02:00.830
foreground color in your left hand and

00:02:01.619 00:02:03.800
then you'll be working the foreground

00:02:04.200 00:02:07.539
color using the Continental technique

00:02:09.409 00:02:13.069
and the background color using the

00:02:13.519 00:02:15.230
English throwing

00:02:19.910 00:02:22.130
style and in this way again if you look

00:02:22.440 00:02:24.200
closely you'll see that the gray is

00:02:24.480 00:02:26.210
always going over the yellow and the

00:02:26.250 00:02:37.880
yellow is coming underneath the gray and

00:02:38.130 00:02:41.750
then finally if you normally knit using

00:02:41.880 00:02:43.340
the continental style with the yarn in

00:02:43.380 00:02:45.950
your left hand you might like to try

00:02:46.320 00:02:48.350
holding both of the yarns in your left

00:02:48.480 00:02:51.560
hand and again we are going to have the

00:02:52.470 00:02:55.130
foreground color on the left hand side

00:02:55.170 00:02:57.350
so we hold both yarns over our index

00:02:57.680 00:03:00.650
finger background color on the right and

00:03:01.410 00:03:04.730
foreground color on the left and then we

00:03:05.010 00:03:07.790
can just take whichever yarn it is that

00:03:08.010 00:03:17.150
we are needing to knit with and again if

00:03:17.310 00:03:19.370
you look closely you'll see behind that

00:03:19.710 00:03:21.830
the yellow is coming from underneath the

00:03:22.050 00:03:24.770
gray and the gray is always coming over

00:03:25.650 00:03:31.850
the yellow which keeps everything as

00:03:32.100 00:03:41.270
it's meant to be so what happens if you

00:03:41.520 00:03:43.580
don't hold them that way around if you

00:03:43.770 00:03:45.890
hold them the opposite way around you'll

00:03:45.990 00:03:48.550
see in these swatches that the

00:03:49.560 00:03:51.920
patterning is much less doesn't stand

00:03:52.050 00:03:53.390
out quite so much especially in

00:03:53.730 00:03:55.010
comparison so it's really important when

00:03:55.140 00:03:57.020
you're making a pair of mittens that you

00:03:57.240 00:03:58.670
hold the ants the same way round for

00:03:58.830 00:04:00.320
both mittens otherwise you'll have one

00:04:00.750 00:04:03.260
that has more bold patterning than the

00:04:03.630 00:04:06.670
second one and if you look at this third

00:04:07.680 00:04:09.500
example you'll see what happens if

00:04:09.660 00:04:11.330
you're slightly inconsistent in how you

00:04:11.670 00:04:13.550
hold the arms if you just pick them up

00:04:14.310 00:04:16.370
in the matter which way round you'll see

00:04:16.560 00:04:18.530
that the work just doesn't look quite as

00:04:18.780 00:04:19.880
neat it's one of those things you might

00:04:20.040 00:04:23.050
not notice until you compare it with

00:04:24.060 00:04:25.909
knitting that's been done differently if

00:04:26.130 00:04:27.260
you're wondering why your ferrule

00:04:27.660 00:04:28.250
doesn't look

00:04:29.190 00:04:30.350
neat and tidy then that's definitely

00:04:30.930 00:04:32.540
something worth checking is how you're

00:04:32.730 00:04:34.850
holding your yarns and are you making

00:04:34.950 00:04:36.980
sure that the the foreground pattern

00:04:37.170 00:04:39.020
color comes from below each time to make

00:04:39.270 00:04:42.920
longer stitches just one last tip to

00:04:43.110 00:04:46.100
show you for fair isle knitting when

00:04:46.290 00:04:47.570
you're working on a small circumference

00:04:47.940 00:04:49.640
in the round sometimes it can be hard to

00:04:49.830 00:04:51.650
make sure that the floats are loose at

00:04:51.830 00:04:55.400
the corners or in any Sun and any of the

00:04:55.710 00:04:56.930
areas especially when you're shaping at

00:04:57.030 00:04:59.660
the tip of a mitten and what I do in

00:04:59.820 00:05:03.590
that situation if I turn the work inside

00:05:05.540 00:05:08.180
out and it's literally just turning it

00:05:08.370 00:05:10.400
inside out there's nothing else to it

00:05:11.540 00:05:14.390
so you're carrying on working as you

00:05:14.580 00:05:18.830
were before but now the tube of knitting

00:05:18.960 00:05:21.590
is inside out and what this does is it

00:05:22.050 00:05:24.590
forces the floats of yarn on the wrong

00:05:24.900 00:05:26.330
side of the work to go around the

00:05:27.200 00:05:29.600
outside so they can't take a shortcut

00:05:29.640 00:05:31.850
like they might do if the bitten is the

00:05:32.040 00:05:34.280
right way out they have to go around the

00:05:34.860 00:05:36.110
outsides and it just keeps everything

00:05:36.510 00:05:39.230
from puckering but you can see I'm

00:05:39.450 00:05:41.270
working exact same way I'm still looking

00:05:41.460 00:05:44.030
at the right side of the knitting it's

00:05:44.310 00:05:46.100
just that the tube itself is inside out

00:05:49.910 00:05:52.400
I hope you've enjoyed this tutorial on

00:05:52.590 00:05:53.840
how to hold your yarns when you're

00:05:54.180 00:05:55.970
working fair isle patterning if you'd
