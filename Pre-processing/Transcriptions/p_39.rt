00:00:00.400 00:00:01.670
i think what i was trying to say is that

00:00:01.839 00:00:03.590
with the fatigue like

00:00:05.279 00:00:07.430
you can't

00:00:07.680 00:00:11.030
you can't like force yourself to go on

00:00:11.599 00:00:13.190
like with when you're tired you can

00:00:13.519 00:00:15.669
still like do things and you

00:00:15.839 00:00:18.630
get rest and like you're okay the next

00:00:20.320 00:00:22.550
but with the fatigue even though you're

00:00:22.800 00:00:25.029
you've got enough rest you're still like

00:00:26.480 00:00:28.150
i think a good example of this what

00:00:28.560 00:00:30.950
happens to me is that like

00:00:31.279 00:00:34.229
i'll get up and if i'm experiencing a

00:00:34.960 00:00:36.229
very um

00:00:36.320 00:00:37.350
you know

00:00:39.200 00:00:40.470
bad fatigue

00:00:40.719 00:00:42.869
i get up i get dressed and ready to go

00:00:43.120 00:00:46.229
for the day but then the fatigue hits me

00:00:46.480 00:00:49.510
and i'm like tired again and i've only

00:00:50.000 00:00:51.350
gotten dressed

00:00:52.640 00:00:53.910
like if i'm

00:00:54.320 00:00:55.590
wasn't experienced fatigued and i was

00:00:55.920 00:00:58.630
just tired then i just go on with my day

00:00:58.800 00:01:00.790
but if it's fatigue

00:01:01.120 00:01:03.349
then i can't go on with my day so i have

00:01:03.840 00:01:06.950
to lay down and rest again

00:01:07.119 00:01:08.630
but it's kind of tricky because if i

00:01:09.040 00:01:11.510
rest too much then it kind of triggers

00:01:11.840 00:01:12.950
more fatigue

00:01:13.200 00:01:16.070
so it's kind of like a vicious circle

00:01:16.320 00:01:20.950
and like so i'm really careful what i do

00:01:21.360 00:01:23.270
throughout the day because

00:01:23.680 00:01:25.910
any kind of thing that throws me off or

00:01:26.080 00:01:29.190
if i get stressed i can experience like

00:01:29.520 00:01:31.990
really really bad fatigue

00:01:32.320 00:01:34.310
and that's not something that i want to

00:01:35.119 00:01:36.230
experience because the really bad

00:01:37.680 00:01:40.550
it might be like a whole two weeks to a

00:01:41.360 00:01:43.749
month before i kind of go back to my

00:01:44.400 00:01:46.950
normal fatigue level

00:01:47.439 00:01:49.510
and when i'm fatigued it doesn't really

00:01:50.000 00:01:52.550
matter what i'm doing or

00:01:52.720 00:01:55.030
just to clarify it doesn't matter if

00:01:55.280 00:01:56.389
what i'm doing

00:01:56.640 00:01:58.469
is something very physical or not

00:02:00.000 00:02:01.910
even if i'm like unloading the

00:02:03.280 00:02:07.030
dishwasher it's extremely hard to do

00:02:07.280 00:02:09.350
and when i'm also fatigued

00:02:09.679 00:02:11.990
because i can't do my regular activity

00:02:12.160 00:02:15.030
it kind of snowballs so like

00:02:15.200 00:02:17.990
i'm fatigued i can't do my exercise if i

00:02:18.160 00:02:21.430
can't do my exercise i can't go dancing

00:02:22.000 00:02:23.110
if if i'm

00:02:23.360 00:02:25.430
not dancing and doing my exercise then

00:02:25.680 00:02:28.710
my stiffness gets worse then my rigidity

00:02:28.959 00:02:31.190
so you kind of get an idea kind of like

00:02:33.440 00:02:35.030
with the fatigue

00:02:35.280 00:02:38.390
i'm trying to think what they actually

00:02:38.640 00:02:40.470
do for the fatigue

00:02:40.640 00:02:43.030
i think what when i did raise it as an

00:02:44.400 00:02:46.070
that they did

00:02:46.959 00:02:47.830
recommend like

00:02:48.080 00:02:50.710
that i visit an occupational therapist

00:02:50.879 00:02:53.270
and the occupational therapist

00:02:53.599 00:02:55.350
kind of

00:02:55.680 00:02:57.509
went through the idea for me that you

00:02:57.760 00:02:59.509
only have a certain amount of energy

00:02:59.760 00:03:02.229
that you can spend each day and my

00:03:02.720 00:03:05.430
energy is limited so that's why i kind

00:03:05.519 00:03:08.550
of got into more like planning my days

00:03:08.800 00:03:10.630
out playing what i'm doing

00:03:14.080 00:03:16.869
i kind of think of it as a car and like

00:03:17.120 00:03:19.750
i've only got a certain amount of gas

00:03:20.000 00:03:22.710
and the gas to me is my medicine

00:03:23.120 00:03:25.270
and when i take the medicine it allows

00:03:25.519 00:03:27.430
me like three hours where i'm not

00:03:29.120 00:03:31.190
but i have to plan because if i'm doing

00:03:32.080 00:03:33.589
something some activities are going to

00:03:33.840 00:03:36.550
take up more gas than other activities

00:03:36.720 00:03:40.149
and so when i've used up all that gas

00:03:40.400 00:03:42.390
i'm kind of like spent

00:03:42.640 00:03:44.550
and i can't take more medication so i

00:03:44.879 00:03:47.509
can't buy more more gas

00:03:48.720 00:03:50.229
my necks fill up

00:03:50.400 00:03:52.630
so i don't make no that makes any sense

00:03:52.799 00:03:55.030
or just confuses the matter but i just

00:03:55.440 00:03:57.110
wanted to kind of start explaining a

00:03:57.360 00:03:59.270
little bit about the fatigue and that it

00:03:59.519 00:04:02.309
is a serious issue with parkinson's

00:04:02.480 00:04:04.070
it is very hard to understand if you

00:04:04.319 00:04:07.030
don't have a chronic disease

00:04:07.200 00:04:08.949
it's the difference between that and

00:04:09.439 00:04:12.439
being tired
