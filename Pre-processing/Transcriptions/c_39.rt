00:00:06.960 00:00:08.230
i've been with this company by the way

00:00:08.480 00:00:09.910
for 10 years with usborne books and more

00:00:10.080 00:00:11.350

00:00:11.599 00:00:13.030
of terrific friends we have books

00:00:13.200 00:00:15.589

00:00:17.520 00:00:18.710
to get into because it helps

00:00:19.359 00:00:21.029
everyone involved it helps your customer

00:00:21.119 00:00:22.150
it helps yourself and it helps your

00:00:22.560 00:00:23.830
family and that is something i can

00:00:24.160 00:00:25.189
always get behind and that's why i've

00:00:25.359 00:00:26.790
been with usborne for 10 years

00:00:27.039 00:00:28.390
so your question so the first question

00:00:28.480 00:00:29.910
that we normally get is how much does it

00:00:30.160 00:00:30.790
cost to start

00:00:31.039 00:00:32.069
so that would be your kit that you

00:00:32.399 00:00:33.590
decide to buy so i'm going to go through

00:00:33.760 00:00:35.190
those with you real quick sorry

00:00:35.440 00:00:36.470
so they're just on the back of our

00:00:36.880 00:00:38.150
catalog here by the way and so here's

00:00:38.399 00:00:40.150
the big kit which is 125

00:00:40.320 00:00:42.389
by the way this is your best value kit

00:00:42.559 00:00:44.069
this one has the most books in it and so

00:00:44.239 00:00:44.549
you get

00:00:44.960 00:00:46.950
quite the discount on your books it has

00:00:47.200 00:00:49.750
um it's only 125 but it has over 275

00:00:50.079 00:00:51.029
dollars worth of

00:00:51.280 00:00:53.350
books and supplies so this you get 20

00:00:53.840 00:00:55.029
titles in that

00:00:55.440 00:00:56.790
and a supply set which has catalogs

00:00:57.280 00:00:58.549
consultant guide hostess guides

00:00:59.039 00:01:01.670
recruiting brochures and a six month

00:01:02.000 00:01:04.070
uh website which is fantastic okay and

00:01:04.320 00:01:05.990
then this 75 dollar kit that you see

00:01:06.960 00:01:08.710
this one has 10 titles so it has half

00:01:08.880 00:01:11.190
the titles um best-selling titles is

00:01:11.360 00:01:12.149
what they always include

00:01:12.320 00:01:13.910
in these kits as well and it has all of

00:01:14.000 00:01:15.190
the other supplies that i mentioned with

00:01:15.280 00:01:16.070
the first kit

00:01:16.240 00:01:17.590
so it's just a matter of how many books

00:01:17.759 00:01:19.429
you might already have or need or if

00:01:19.680 00:01:21.350
you're on a budget and you just need to

00:01:21.600 00:01:23.510
get a small kit that's absolutely fine

00:01:23.680 00:01:25.749
we also have this little add-on this has

00:01:26.159 00:01:27.910
extra supplies in it

00:01:28.479 00:01:30.069
so this has order forms and other things

00:01:30.560 00:01:31.350
basically our kits now

00:01:32.240 00:01:33.270
are programmed so that you can just

00:01:33.520 00:01:34.710
start on facebook parties if you'd like

00:01:34.880 00:01:36.069
if you really want to be doing more home

00:01:36.400 00:01:37.350
parties and things you might want to go

00:01:37.520 00:01:38.469
ahead and get that little business

00:01:38.960 00:01:39.429
add-on kit

00:01:39.680 00:01:41.109
because that's going to have bags and

00:01:41.280 00:01:42.710
all sorts of other supplies even

00:01:42.880 00:01:44.069
some fun pens for you to use at your

00:01:44.399 00:01:46.550
party so you decide you are in control

00:01:46.640 00:01:47.749
of that and you get to make the decision

00:01:47.920 00:01:49.910
on what kit you decide to purchase so

00:01:50.240 00:01:51.590
um number two how much money am i going

00:01:51.680 00:01:53.190
to make so we find that on average

00:01:53.439 00:01:55.190
people make about 75 to 100

00:01:55.439 00:01:57.749
on a party and so if you have a party a

00:01:58.000 00:01:59.350
week then you would make about 300 to

00:02:00.640 00:02:02.709
extra a month this is fantastic but

00:02:02.960 00:02:03.830
guess what you can

00:02:04.079 00:02:05.109
actually make a lot more in this

00:02:05.520 00:02:06.469
business and so that's the wonderful

00:02:06.640 00:02:07.670
thing we have all sorts of different

00:02:08.879 00:02:09.910
and other things that you can get in

00:02:10.160 00:02:11.589
each month number three how much do you

00:02:11.760 00:02:12.390
work on average

00:02:12.879 00:02:14.229
great question so we found that the

00:02:14.560 00:02:15.910
people that are the most successful

00:02:16.239 00:02:18.470
work about three to four days a week at

00:02:18.720 00:02:19.750
least 30 minutes a day

00:02:19.920 00:02:21.750
and then about one to two nights a week

00:02:22.080 00:02:23.750
doing a facebook party or a home party

00:02:23.920 00:02:25.270
and that is a great way to do it i know

00:02:26.080 00:02:27.510
i work when my son's down for a nap and

00:02:27.680 00:02:28.790
then i work a little bit at night as

00:02:29.840 00:02:31.190
all right you can totally work this

00:02:31.440 00:02:32.470
around your family life and that's what

00:02:32.560 00:02:34.150
i love about it no one's telling you

00:02:34.400 00:02:36.229
when and how to work you're your own

00:02:36.560 00:02:37.589
boss and you get to

00:02:37.760 00:02:39.830
make those decisions and you decide when

00:02:39.920 00:02:41.030
you want to go on vacation you just

00:02:41.360 00:02:42.470
schedule it out and then you make sure

00:02:42.640 00:02:43.190
you don't

00:02:43.360 00:02:44.949
have any events during that time so it's

00:02:45.440 00:02:46.229
fabulous for that

00:02:46.640 00:02:48.309
i know i've worked nine to five schedule

00:02:48.640 00:02:50.390
before and this is far better to be able

00:02:50.560 00:02:52.470
to make up whatever i want on my

00:02:54.319 00:02:55.830
okay so number four question number four

00:02:55.920 00:02:57.030
that we usually get is who pays for the

00:02:57.519 00:02:58.630
hostess is free and half price books and

00:02:58.800 00:02:59.110
guess what

00:02:59.280 00:03:00.949
it's our home office it's all programmed

00:03:01.200 00:03:02.390
into each party that you do

00:03:02.560 00:03:03.910
you can go ahead and put the hostesses

00:03:04.159 00:03:04.949
things in there and you don't have to

00:03:05.120 00:03:06.070
worry about it coming out of your

00:03:07.519 00:03:09.350
the next question number five do you

00:03:09.519 00:03:11.030
have to keep an inventory

00:03:11.280 00:03:13.270
and do you make delivery so no to both

00:03:13.360 00:03:14.550
of those by the way you don't have to

00:03:14.720 00:03:15.830
keep an inventory if you'd like to have

00:03:16.000 00:03:17.350
an inventory for events or something

00:03:17.440 00:03:19.190
like that you can certainly accrue one

00:03:19.599 00:03:21.990
um little by little at deeply discounted

00:03:23.200 00:03:24.149
uh do you need to make deliveries

00:03:24.560 00:03:25.509
absolutely not just go ahead and send

00:03:25.760 00:03:26.789
those to the hostess and then don't have

00:03:26.879 00:03:28.550
to worry about those at all

00:03:28.879 00:03:30.229
number six is do you have a support

00:03:30.560 00:03:31.990
system well of course we want to help

00:03:32.319 00:03:33.509

00:03:40.640 00:03:41.910
consultant success plan and that is a

00:03:42.159 00:03:43.509
plan that we have all

00:03:43.840 00:03:44.630

00:03:48.720 00:03:49.350
short time

00:03:49.440 00:03:50.630

00:03:52.159 00:03:53.589

00:03:59.680 00:04:01.190
all right we also have online videos

00:04:01.360 00:04:03.190

on there but there's also videos so you

00:04:06.159 00:04:07.830
can go at whatever your pace is so if

00:04:07.920 00:04:09.190
you need to go slower or faster than

00:04:09.439 00:04:10.630
others that's wonderful

00:04:10.799 00:04:13.589
you get to decide that as well okay so

00:04:13.920 00:04:14.470
number seven

00:04:14.640 00:04:17.030
the one that i always get is what if i'm

00:04:17.280 00:04:18.949
not a salesperson

00:04:19.199 00:04:20.390
uh the thing that i have to answer to

00:04:20.560 00:04:21.990
this is you don't need to be like the

00:04:22.320 00:04:23.590
icky sales person that you usually think

00:04:23.759 00:04:24.950
of when you think of that

00:04:25.199 00:04:27.270
you can be the awesome one the one that

00:04:27.680 00:04:29.189
just simply supplies great books to

00:04:29.440 00:04:30.870
people that are looking to help

00:04:31.199 00:04:32.310
improve their literacy and that's the

00:04:32.639 00:04:33.670
awesome thing that i can totally get

00:04:34.000 00:04:35.110
behind in this business

00:04:35.360 00:04:37.350
it is that i can help people improve

00:04:37.520 00:04:38.310
their literacy

00:04:38.479 00:04:39.830

never feel bad when someone buys a book

00:04:41.600 00:04:42.390
for me because i know they're going to

00:04:42.639 00:04:44.150
read to a child or an adult and that

00:04:44.479 00:04:45.510
makes our world better

00:04:46.240 00:04:47.909
