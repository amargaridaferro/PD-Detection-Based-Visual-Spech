00:00:00.060 00:00:02.990
I am a huge Jurassic Park fan and I just

00:00:03.240 00:00:05.329

00:00:15.179 00:00:17.090
welcome to Germania I'm Durban and this

00:00:17.369 00:00:19.250
is my spoiler talk book review for

00:00:19.890 00:00:22.279
Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park I read

00:00:23.010 00:00:24.590
the Jurassic Park novel once a long time

00:00:24.840 00:00:26.859
ago is either in high school or college

00:00:27.869 00:00:29.900
but it was a long time ago because I

00:00:30.300 00:00:32.840
just love Jurassic Park it's just what

00:00:33.210 00:00:35.030
it is like my favorite movie of all time

00:00:35.700 00:00:36.799
so I got a hold of the novel and I read

00:00:36.930 00:00:37.850
it but it's been so long I couldn't

00:00:38.040 00:00:39.229
remember anything and then my mom and

00:00:39.719 00:00:41.150

they got me this it's this two volume

00:00:43.860 00:00:46.220
it's got Jurassic Park and it has the

00:00:46.469 00:00:47.840
lost world I mean look how cool this

00:00:47.910 00:00:49.970
thing is this is so clean anyway so it

00:00:50.070 00:00:52.100
was awesome to get this book and I just

00:00:52.829 00:00:54.680
finished the Jurassic Park novel I'm

00:00:54.960 00:00:57.170
gonna dive into it spoilers and also if

00:00:57.329 00:01:00.110
you want some spoilers let's do this so

00:01:00.149 00:01:02.599
I read this novel in like three days by

00:01:02.670 00:01:04.160
this novel I mean Jurassic Park I did

00:01:04.290 00:01:06.140
not read this whole thick thing in like

00:01:06.479 00:01:07.850
three days but just the first one

00:01:08.280 00:01:09.530
Jurassic Park I got it done in three

00:01:09.720 00:01:12.170
days I absolutely could not put it down

00:01:12.900 00:01:15.020
it was just really cool to read Michael

00:01:15.450 00:01:16.910
Crichton's vision and how he started

00:01:17.070 00:01:18.770
this world and what inspired the movies

00:01:18.900 00:01:20.300
and it helps I'm such a mega fan of

00:01:20.759 00:01:21.770
Jurassic Park and you know have that

00:01:22.170 00:01:24.710
movie just so solid in my head but as

00:01:24.840 00:01:26.660
I'm reading the book like there are so

00:01:26.790 00:01:28.910
many fascinating story elements that I

00:01:29.250 00:01:30.980
just thought were amazing that were

00:01:31.409 00:01:32.420
different than the film now the film

00:01:32.610 00:01:33.890
should be untouchable I think Jurassic

00:01:34.049 00:01:35.690
Park the film is perfect as it is

00:01:36.329 00:01:37.940
because if they took Michael Crichton's

00:01:38.009 00:01:39.920
novel and word-for-word translated that

00:01:40.049 00:01:42.289
to the screen it would be a rated R Gore

00:01:42.600 00:01:44.600
fest and borderline horror film with

00:01:44.790 00:01:46.130
some of the things Michael Crichton does

00:01:46.320 00:01:48.469
with these dinosaurs but I loved reading

00:01:48.810 00:01:50.389
it that way in the novel and I love

00:01:50.579 00:01:52.280
having my movie the way it is but one of

00:01:52.350 00:01:53.149
the things that I liked that was

00:01:53.399 00:01:54.859
slightly different than the movie was

00:01:55.049 00:01:56.840
the storyline of man's pride

00:01:57.090 00:01:58.670
now at its base it's the same as the

00:01:58.950 00:02:00.170
movie you know they believe all the

00:02:00.630 00:02:02.090
dinosaurs are female they can't breathe

00:02:02.460 00:02:04.940
out in the wild and they boast of all of

00:02:05.070 00:02:07.490
this control that they have but novels

00:02:07.649 00:02:09.350
can do things different than movies and

00:02:09.420 00:02:10.729
they can get into people's thoughts and

00:02:11.220 00:02:12.650
intents and feelings and things like

00:02:12.870 00:02:13.460
that really

00:02:13.620 00:02:15.200
well and so michael creighton does a

00:02:15.660 00:02:17.480
great job doing that with this novel

00:02:17.580 00:02:19.430
because as he's digging into their pride

00:02:20.280 00:02:21.920
there they think they're so untouchable

00:02:22.740 00:02:24.410
that they've created a computer program

00:02:24.780 00:02:25.910
system and what this computer does is it

00:02:26.160 00:02:27.290
counts the dinosaurs and it does this

00:02:27.360 00:02:29.780
through like these monitors and motion

00:02:30.120 00:02:31.760
sensor things and cameras all out in the

00:02:31.980 00:02:33.290
park and so this thing is so

00:02:34.140 00:02:35.270
state-of-the-art that it counts the

00:02:35.700 00:02:36.680
dinosaurs and it's so state-of-the-art

00:02:37.050 00:02:38.270
what they've told the computer to do is

00:02:39.120 00:02:42.530
only look for 235 animals because there

00:02:42.660 00:02:44.150
could be no more than that unless the

00:02:44.730 00:02:46.190
scientists create a new animal and put

00:02:46.290 00:02:48.350
it in there I think 235 is the right

00:02:48.570 00:02:49.760
number I think they believe they have

00:02:50.990 00:02:53.030
235 separate dinosaurs on the island

00:02:53.130 00:02:55.760
like 15 species but either way we'll

00:02:55.950 00:02:57.020
just use the number for this example

00:02:57.300 00:02:58.310
whether it's right or wrong so they

00:02:58.620 00:03:00.560
believe there were 235 animals so they

00:03:00.630 00:03:03.440
told the computer only look for 235 if

00:03:03.959 00:03:06.830
it drops under 235 an animal has gotten

00:03:06.930 00:03:08.330
out of its cage someone has gotten out

00:03:08.490 00:03:10.910
of its pin and therefore an alert gets

00:03:11.310 00:03:12.949
triggered but it will never count higher

00:03:12.990 00:03:16.100
than 235 because they are so full of

00:03:16.320 00:03:17.449
themselves that they've created their

00:03:17.489 00:03:19.460
own little blind spot over here so they

00:03:19.650 00:03:21.290
won't even dare to look over here

00:03:21.600 00:03:23.360
because there's no way it could increase

00:03:24.150 00:03:25.610
so in the book when they go on the tour

00:03:25.800 00:03:26.840
like they do in the movie where the cars

00:03:27.060 00:03:28.460
with no drivers and it kind of just goes

00:03:28.920 00:03:30.470
and whatever instead of a sick

00:03:30.720 00:03:32.780
Triceratops it's a six dagger source in

00:03:32.880 00:03:34.759
the book so grant gets out and Ellie you

00:03:34.860 00:03:36.199
know does her doctor thing looking at

00:03:36.330 00:03:37.970
the Stegosaurus but grant being a

00:03:38.269 00:03:40.940
paleontologist notices Velociraptor eggs

00:03:41.550 00:03:43.310
this is his life so when he looks out of

00:03:43.500 00:03:44.960
loss of Raptor egg he knows what he's

00:03:45.150 00:03:46.520
seen so he picks up his egg and he's

00:03:46.680 00:03:48.530
like they're breeding in the wild this

00:03:48.690 00:03:51.050
is a Velociraptor egg and so they used

00:03:51.180 00:03:52.130
the radio and they call back to the

00:03:52.530 00:03:53.330
control room they talk about these

00:03:54.030 00:03:55.190
Velociraptor eggs and and the control

00:03:55.410 00:03:57.110
room is blindsided by this - like what

00:03:57.720 00:03:59.320
it's all females out there that's

00:04:00.330 00:04:02.780
impossible there is no way that you have

00:04:02.910 00:04:04.610
found Velociraptor eggs there so Ian

00:04:04.830 00:04:07.550
Malcolm in his cocky attitude picks up

00:04:07.650 00:04:09.140
the walkie-talkie calls the control room

00:04:09.269 00:04:11.960
and he's like hey there um let's just do

00:04:12.000 00:04:13.250
a little science experiment

00:04:13.709 00:04:15.380
humor me humor me cuz you know according

00:04:15.690 00:04:18.080
you I'm wrong so instead of telling the

00:04:18.269 00:04:20.750
computer look for 235 dinosaurs look

00:04:21.690 00:04:23.450
300 so they went okay fine with human

00:04:23.580 00:04:25.370
you they told the computer look for 300

00:04:26.150 00:04:29.870
dinosaurs they found 300 dinosaurs there

00:04:30.030 00:04:32.480
were 300 there was not 235 bad like

00:04:33.090 00:04:34.100
double the amount of velociraptors

00:04:34.650 00:04:35.720
that's the part that scared them the

00:04:35.880 00:04:38.180
most double the velociraptors but just

00:04:38.370 00:04:39.170
throughout each of the Pens as they're

00:04:39.450 00:04:41.330
counting the 15 species like some of

00:04:41.430 00:04:42.710
them the same number like there was two

00:04:43.320 00:04:44.270
Tyrannosaurus rexes yeah there's two in

00:04:44.430 00:04:46.220
this book you have the adult Rex and you

00:04:46.320 00:04:48.080
have little Rex jr. so you have two T

00:04:48.510 00:04:50.030
Rex's in this so all those numbers stay

00:04:50.190 00:04:52.430
the same but the velociraptors had

00:04:52.920 00:04:55.220
doubled and now there's velociraptor

00:04:55.440 00:04:58.310
eggs outside of the velociraptor pinned

00:04:58.740 00:05:00.470
and there's no problem with the park yet

00:05:00.810 00:05:02.330
Dennis Nedry hasn't betrayed everybody

00:05:02.520 00:05:04.490
isn't turned off the fences and so it

00:05:04.800 00:05:06.200
really plays with the fright of man in

00:05:06.360 00:05:09.160
that that in their pride they willfully

00:05:10.170 00:05:11.360
blinded themselves and said we're only

00:05:11.580 00:05:12.740
gonna look for this number

00:05:13.170 00:05:14.480
anything drops below it that's cool let

00:05:14.730 00:05:17.480
alone golf anything above it well that

00:05:17.820 00:05:19.310
can't happen well it happened the other

00:05:19.620 00:05:20.840
thing that was really interesting is

00:05:21.420 00:05:23.690
this novel opens the way the lost world

00:05:24.120 00:05:25.850
movie opens with that girl on the beach

00:05:26.310 00:05:27.770
and the little green copies those little

00:05:27.930 00:05:29.450
things and they're like jumping on her

00:05:29.610 00:05:31.370
and all that stuff that's the opening of

00:05:31.530 00:05:32.960
the novel and what makes it more

00:05:33.450 00:05:34.610
interesting to have it be the opener of

00:05:34.860 00:05:37.550
the first novel is it's showing here are

00:05:37.680 00:05:39.350
these guys from the beginning they think

00:05:39.480 00:05:41.000
they have all this control but they

00:05:41.340 00:05:43.310
don't they have no control because the

00:05:43.710 00:05:45.800
copies that was not the main Jurassic

00:05:45.990 00:05:46.940
Park Island no this was like the

00:05:47.430 00:05:48.680
mainland are some other Island but it

00:05:48.840 00:05:51.350
was not the island of the dinosaurs so

00:05:51.540 00:05:53.690
from the beginning of the novel we get

00:05:53.850 00:05:55.310
the idea dinosaurs already getting off

00:05:55.440 00:05:56.840
this island somehow they've already

00:05:57.450 00:05:59.270
found ways off the island and they're

00:05:59.730 00:06:01.730
already spreading and the copies have

00:06:02.040 00:06:03.290
attacked this little girl and in this

00:06:03.540 00:06:04.610
place where the copies are attacking

00:06:04.740 00:06:07.670
them on the mainland it was one story in

00:06:07.830 00:06:10.520
a number of stories of babies being bit

00:06:10.560 00:06:13.220
by weird lizards that walk upright and

00:06:13.800 00:06:16.190
so like these weird lizard stories are

00:06:16.860 00:06:18.080
spreading and they are spreading

00:06:18.510 00:06:20.390
everywhere and so that was an incredibly

00:06:21.030 00:06:22.820
interesting storyline to illustrate the

00:06:23.070 00:06:25.400
fact that they firmly believed they had

00:06:25.680 00:06:27.920
all of this control but from the very

00:06:28.440 00:06:30.950
beginning of the novel they truly had no

00:06:31.410 00:06:32.900
control so I found it interesting the

00:06:33.030 00:06:34.970
way Michael Crichton was illustrating

00:06:35.130 00:06:36.680
that and the way that he put that in the

00:06:36.900 00:06:38.060
book and the way he wrote it in the

00:06:38.400 00:06:39.860
novel was just it was such a fascinating

00:06:40.470 00:06:42.020
concept to me there were certain

00:06:42.510 00:06:43.700
characters that were done differently in

00:06:43.860 00:06:45.770
the novel than in the movie and so I

00:06:45.960 00:06:47.180
thought that was really interesting like

00:06:47.790 00:06:49.460
first off Tim and Lex so in the movie

00:06:49.830 00:06:51.050
Lex is the older one and she's the

00:06:51.480 00:06:52.580
computer nerd and Tim is the dinosaur

00:06:52.890 00:06:54.530
nerd and he's the younger one but in the

00:06:55.290 00:06:57.110
Tim is the older one and Tim is the

00:06:57.540 00:06:59.570
computer nerd and the dinosaur nerd Lex

00:06:59.730 00:07:01.040
is like eight or nine years old she's

00:07:01.200 00:07:03.890
like a little kid and you know she's a

00:07:04.230 00:07:05.570
tomboy I mean she's got her baseball

00:07:05.820 00:07:07.550
glove and her baseball and and I mean

00:07:07.740 00:07:09.470
she thinks her brother's a nerd and like

00:07:09.810 00:07:11.420
all that stuff so it provided some

00:07:11.550 00:07:13.550
excellent comedic relief like places

00:07:13.740 00:07:15.650
where Lexi's a baby Triceratops and she

00:07:15.870 00:07:18.080
names it Ralph and you know she you know

00:07:18.480 00:07:20.210
starts petting a baby Velociraptor I

00:07:20.610 00:07:21.770
forget what she named it but she finds

00:07:21.930 00:07:23.510
these little baby dinosaurs and they

00:07:23.820 00:07:25.159
attach to her because she's so sweet

00:07:25.410 00:07:27.170
and she gives them name so there's cute

00:07:27.360 00:07:28.670
little Lex moments where she's kind of a

00:07:29.100 00:07:31.010
comedic relief in a very tense book but

00:07:31.169 00:07:32.420
then all of a sudden you have a moment

00:07:32.520 00:07:33.800
where she sneezes and it wakes up the

00:07:34.110 00:07:35.330
t-rex and they get chased by a transfer

00:07:35.990 00:07:38.720
class so freaking annoying so 2:1 and

00:07:39.120 00:07:40.370
she's like the comedic relief on the

00:07:40.560 00:07:42.740
other hand she's the child that sneezes

00:07:42.900 00:07:44.750
at the most inopportune time and then

00:07:44.910 00:07:46.880
the dinosaurs find them and so it's very

00:07:47.400 00:07:48.409
interesting the way they played with

00:07:48.600 00:07:49.850
those characters another character

00:07:50.100 00:07:52.730
choice that's interesting is Gennaro you

00:07:53.070 00:07:54.050
remember him from the movie because he

00:07:54.240 00:07:55.610
got eaten off the toilet like that's his

00:07:55.800 00:07:57.380
most memorable thing he gets eaten off

00:07:57.510 00:07:59.210
the toilet by the rex in the movie he's

00:07:59.460 00:08:01.159
asked easy he's asked easy lawyer who

00:08:01.380 00:08:03.260
you want to get eaten in the book

00:08:03.660 00:08:04.940
however he is also asked easy lawyer

00:08:05.160 00:08:06.200
who's not paying attention to him and

00:08:06.330 00:08:07.550
he's taking care of Hammonds Affairs he

00:08:07.770 00:08:08.960
knows there's dinosaurs on the island

00:08:09.300 00:08:10.909
and he's done what was needed to be done

00:08:11.070 00:08:12.440
so engine could get the money and

00:08:12.960 00:08:14.060
incorporate and create these dinosaurs

00:08:14.250 00:08:15.710
so he's kind of blindly done the stuff

00:08:15.870 00:08:16.520
like a

00:08:17.070 00:08:18.590
without asking too many questions cuz he

00:08:18.630 00:08:19.970
just wanted the money so he's definitely

00:08:20.100 00:08:21.740
got the wormy traits that he had in the

00:08:22.020 00:08:23.600
film but in the novel he's slightly

00:08:24.030 00:08:25.159
different number one he survives he

00:08:25.410 00:08:27.290
makes it the whole way through and does

00:08:27.510 00:08:30.200
not die and he has a lot of worming

00:08:30.540 00:08:31.640
moments but I think he's got a few

00:08:32.190 00:08:33.440
heroic moments in the book as he's

00:08:33.660 00:08:34.940
traveling to the island he goes with the

00:08:35.099 00:08:36.709
game warden Muldoon instead of Elliot

00:08:37.020 00:08:38.120
Muldoon like when the Raptors are coming

00:08:38.280 00:08:40.850
he's like it's alright run and Ellie

00:08:41.219 00:08:43.040
runs and you know he's hunting the

00:08:43.380 00:08:44.660
Raptors that are really hunting

00:08:44.910 00:08:46.940
so it's Muldoon and Gennaro together and

00:08:47.070 00:08:48.650
so it's kind of an interesting pairing

00:08:48.870 00:08:50.000
and so there's a couple areas where it's

00:08:50.160 00:08:51.860
like Gennaro man's up and then a lot of

00:08:52.260 00:08:54.470
areas where he just cares right back and

00:08:54.690 00:08:56.450
so he's kind of an interesting character

00:08:56.610 00:08:58.310
for me in the book the third character I

00:08:58.380 00:08:59.900
want to talk about is John Hammond in

00:09:00.420 00:09:05.030
the film he is very naive and makes very

00:09:05.700 00:09:07.820
stupid choices but he's got a heart of

00:09:08.070 00:09:10.790
gold so stupid choice for example he

00:09:11.190 00:09:12.470
invites Tim and Lex to the island but

00:09:12.600 00:09:13.910
the heart of gold is that's his

00:09:14.610 00:09:15.320
grandchildren and their parents are

00:09:15.570 00:09:16.880
getting a divorce so he wants them to

00:09:16.950 00:09:19.280
have a fun weekend with the magic of

00:09:19.920 00:09:22.430
dinosaurs so stupid choice but a golden

00:09:22.710 00:09:25.610
heart John Hammond and the novel is just

00:09:26.310 00:09:29.090
greedy and evil to the core in fact I

00:09:29.130 00:09:31.370
just can't stand the character in the

00:09:31.500 00:09:33.590
novel he's so freakin evil the reason he

00:09:33.839 00:09:35.360
brings Tim and Lex to the island in the

00:09:35.820 00:09:37.579
novel it's so that Gennaro and the other

00:09:37.920 00:09:39.350
people that are there to you know look

00:09:39.540 00:09:40.850
at the island so that they can see the

00:09:41.250 00:09:42.620
Wonder in the kids eyes he brought his

00:09:43.290 00:09:44.000
grandchildren the parents are still

00:09:44.160 00:09:45.440
going through a divorce but he brought

00:09:45.630 00:09:48.050
them as a boy so that nobody would close

00:09:48.240 00:09:49.520
down the island and they would go oh I

00:09:49.890 00:09:52.340
get your vision him and I get it see him

00:09:52.560 00:09:54.200
and he wanted to patent the dinosaur DNA

00:09:54.480 00:09:56.630
to make as much money as possible off of

00:09:56.760 00:09:58.610
it and he actually did own the patent of

00:09:59.040 00:10:00.890
the Dino DNA that brought the dinosaurs

00:10:01.140 00:10:01.640
back to life

00:10:01.860 00:10:03.890
he owns the freakin patent on it and so

00:10:04.530 00:10:06.650
he is greedy to the core he is like one

00:10:06.690 00:10:08.420
of the worst types of people and he's so

00:10:09.060 00:10:10.310
irritating in the book and he dies in

00:10:10.410 00:10:12.800
the book whereas the movie he lives he

00:10:13.110 00:10:14.660
dies in the novel it's like towards the

00:10:14.790 00:10:16.010
end he rolls down this hill and he

00:10:16.470 00:10:18.200
Brinks breaks his ankle and as he's

00:10:18.330 00:10:19.640
trying to climb back up the hill and

00:10:19.740 00:10:21.260
he's limping and he's old and he can't

00:10:21.480 00:10:23.150
do it the copies they're like scavengers

00:10:23.640 00:10:24.740
so they attack him and eat him and

00:10:24.900 00:10:26.180
they're poisonous they bite you it

00:10:26.430 00:10:27.980
releases a poison and you kind of get

00:10:28.110 00:10:29.720
all relaxed in your fork so he just kind

00:10:29.760 00:10:31.430
of falls asleep as they're eating him

00:10:31.530 00:10:34.520
alive but he's such he's such an

00:10:35.690 00:10:38.780
annoying annoying stereotypical greedy

00:10:39.120 00:10:40.010
dude throughout the book that by the

00:10:40.230 00:10:41.420
time he's getting eaten you're like oh

00:10:41.880 00:10:43.220
good I don't even feel bad for the kids

00:10:43.470 00:10:44.600
because I don't even think the kids know

00:10:44.670 00:10:46.070
this this guy laughs because I don't

00:10:46.200 00:10:47.570
think they like him so much so it's like

00:10:47.790 00:10:50.840
ah anyway so it's very interesting the

00:10:51.510 00:10:53.090
similarities and the differences in the

00:10:53.580 00:10:54.980
characters the next really huge thing

00:10:55.440 00:10:56.930
that's really different in the novel

00:10:57.120 00:10:57.950
than in the movie that I want

00:10:58.260 00:11:00.440
talk about is grant kind of has this

00:11:01.110 00:11:02.510
mission going on so right before the

00:11:02.700 00:11:04.190
power goes out so you know in the movie

00:11:04.710 00:11:06.170
there at the t-rex pin the power goes

00:11:06.390 00:11:08.240
out t-rex breaks out rips apart the Cars

00:11:08.490 00:11:10.790
one of my favorite scenes in the movie

00:11:11.250 00:11:12.620
but what kind of it takes that and makes

00:11:12.750 00:11:14.390
it even more intense is the fact that

00:11:14.820 00:11:16.580
right before that happens right before

00:11:16.710 00:11:18.110
the power goes out and they stop in

00:11:18.240 00:11:20.360
front of the t-rex pinned Grant is

00:11:20.670 00:11:21.920
sitting in the car in the car ahead of

00:11:22.050 00:11:23.480
them the radios connected to cars so

00:11:23.580 00:11:24.620
they can hear what's going on in each

00:11:24.900 00:11:26.210
car the kids are like what's that on the

00:11:26.430 00:11:27.830
boat what's that on the boat so grant

00:11:28.620 00:11:29.870
pulls out his binoculars and looks at

00:11:30.000 00:11:31.430
the boat that's leaving the island and

00:11:31.770 00:11:33.800
heading towards the mainland and he sees

00:11:34.560 00:11:38.240
three Raptors on the boat so even before

00:11:38.550 00:11:40.370
the fences are down again we emphasize

00:11:40.560 00:11:42.530
they really had no control and freaking

00:11:43.200 00:11:45.290
smart as anything else velociraptors are

00:11:45.690 00:11:47.240
on the freaking boat they caught the

00:11:47.430 00:11:48.740
boat and they're heading to the mainland

00:11:49.200 00:11:51.140
so grant has this sight mission of I

00:11:51.990 00:11:53.060
gotta get to the visitor center the

00:11:53.490 00:11:55.220
control room as fast as possible and

00:11:55.800 00:11:57.170
tell them what I saw so they could call

00:11:57.360 00:11:59.390
that boat back and he's like okay I got

00:11:59.790 00:12:01.820
12 hours 12 hours then the power goes

00:12:01.980 00:12:04.640
out then baby Rex gets out of the cage

00:12:04.890 00:12:06.320
and runs across the street then the

00:12:06.720 00:12:08.000
t-rex Briggs into the base and starts

00:12:08.280 00:12:10.610
ripping apart the cars which sidenote I

00:12:11.430 00:12:12.620
love how they did it in the movie it's

00:12:13.140 00:12:15.050
perfect because it's hard to do what's

00:12:15.240 00:12:16.880
written in the book the book it takes it

00:12:16.950 00:12:18.320
from the perspective of the kids when

00:12:18.420 00:12:20.600
the t-rex is ripping the car apart that

00:12:21.120 00:12:22.910
the kids when that when the t-rex is

00:12:23.490 00:12:24.680
stomping down on the car they hear the

00:12:24.990 00:12:26.840
claws scraping against the metal they

00:12:27.060 00:12:28.550
hear the metal crunching then crack the

00:12:29.040 00:12:31.850
glass breaking the t-rex like puts its

00:12:32.130 00:12:33.590
tongue in the car looking for the kids

00:12:33.840 00:12:36.350
and it describes how putrid it smelled

00:12:36.690 00:12:39.140
in the the smell of death and rot that

00:12:39.360 00:12:41.480
is in the breath of the t-rex and then

00:12:41.640 00:12:43.310
the t-rex with his powerful jaws lifts

00:12:43.470 00:12:45.320
up the car and throws it in a tree Lex

00:12:45.450 00:12:46.730
had already fallen out but Tim was in

00:12:46.860 00:12:48.620
there but as this is describing it this

00:12:48.780 00:12:49.790
is those scenes where it felt like a

00:12:50.220 00:12:51.350
horror novel to me cuz from the kids

00:12:51.540 00:12:53.600
perspective they can't see everything

00:12:53.850 00:12:54.980
the Rex is doing so from their

00:12:55.140 00:12:56.960
perspective the ceiling is coming down

00:12:57.030 00:12:59.300
on them the crazy sounds the horrible

00:12:59.670 00:13:02.510
smells the awful roar of the Rex as it's

00:13:03.210 00:13:04.970
frustrated because it saw the park

00:13:05.280 00:13:06.470
tour-guide that was in the car with the

00:13:06.720 00:13:08.450
kids get out and run for the woods so it

00:13:08.760 00:13:10.010
knows there's something about this car

00:13:10.260 00:13:11.930
and so it's coming to this car and

00:13:12.180 00:13:14.360
can't find the meat it's like when you

00:13:14.580 00:13:16.400
have a crab and you're eating crab and

00:13:16.500 00:13:17.570
you're trying to break apart the legs

00:13:17.760 00:13:18.800
and you can't get the meat you just get

00:13:18.900 00:13:20.330
so frustrated you throw the crab like

00:13:20.490 00:13:22.190
down in your dad like I mean that's like

00:13:22.440 00:13:23.450
what it felt like to me when I was

00:13:23.850 00:13:25.430
reading this portion of the novel but

00:13:25.620 00:13:27.290
the way it describes it from the kids

00:13:27.510 00:13:30.200
perspective adds so much intensity in so

00:13:30.390 00:13:32.420
much fear and the park tour guide that

00:13:32.520 00:13:34.100
was in the car with the kids he ran and

00:13:34.230 00:13:35.360
it's interesting as the book dives into

00:13:35.580 00:13:37.580
it he ran because he's seen enough of

00:13:37.710 00:13:39.020
his friends and co-workers eaten by

00:13:39.210 00:13:40.220
these dinosaurs he didn't want to be

00:13:40.440 00:13:43.310
next so he runs into the woods but the

00:13:43.560 00:13:45.080
baby Rex is in the woods the baby Rex

00:13:45.300 00:13:46.910
got out the baby Rex is in the woods and

00:13:47.280 00:13:49.580
the baby Rex finds this guy and starts

00:13:49.710 00:13:50.870
to play with him like it pushes him in

00:13:50.970 00:13:52.070
the mud the guy gets up goes leave me

00:13:52.350 00:13:54.080
alone the Rex pushes him back in the mud

00:13:54.570 00:13:56.240
this happens several times over like he

00:13:56.370 00:13:58.040
gets up Rex pushes him he gets up Rex

00:13:58.380 00:13:59.450
pushes him he gets up the Rex eats him

00:13:59.820 00:14:02.150
yes eventually finally a baby Rex ate

00:14:02.520 00:14:04.070
the guy and so what he was trying to

00:14:04.230 00:14:06.280
avoid he ended up getting and so it's

00:14:07.290 00:14:08.510
it's interesting the way it dives into

00:14:08.760 00:14:10.340
that and then it dives into the logic of

00:14:10.800 00:14:12.140
okay so Allan and the kids that could

00:14:12.240 00:14:13.760
have followed the road back to the

00:14:14.100 00:14:14.960
visitor center it would have been a more

00:14:15.300 00:14:16.640
direct path but then there's the baby

00:14:16.980 00:14:18.140
Rex they didn't know where the big Rex

00:14:18.390 00:14:19.760
went after it was done tearing apart the

00:14:19.950 00:14:21.680
cars but then the baby Rex comes up and

00:14:21.930 00:14:23.150
then they run into the park because they

00:14:23.310 00:14:25.220
got to get away from the baby Rex and

00:14:25.920 00:14:28.100
you still have Alan grants side quest he

00:14:28.290 00:14:30.890
has now you know eleven and a half hours

00:14:31.140 00:14:33.710
to get to the control room and call back

00:14:33.960 00:14:35.600
the boat but they just been attacked by

00:14:35.640 00:14:37.400
a Rex so they're really tired so they go

00:14:37.560 00:14:38.870
into this utility shed that's in the

00:14:39.090 00:14:39.980
woods and they fall asleep in the

00:14:40.500 00:14:41.900
utility shed and he only meant to close

00:14:42.060 00:14:43.490
his eyes for like an hour and he wakes

00:14:43.740 00:14:46.550
up eight flippin hours later he has lost

00:14:46.890 00:14:48.950
eight hours of time to call back the

00:14:49.140 00:14:50.930
boat so they get out of the utility shed

00:14:51.090 00:14:52.010
to go on the next part of their

00:14:52.380 00:14:53.870
adventure in temp says look a river Hey

00:14:54.120 00:14:55.460
look we can blow up one of those

00:14:56.010 00:14:57.410
emergency rafts and they're like yes

00:14:57.690 00:14:59.870
they get to the rash and the t-rex is

00:15:00.210 00:15:02.330
asleep by the riverbank just snoring and

00:15:02.550 00:15:04.850
so Allan he gets the raft blown up as

00:15:05.430 00:15:06.950
quietly as possible he gets the kids on

00:15:07.050 00:15:08.390
the little raft they get in the river

00:15:08.700 00:15:11.450
and Lex sneezes and the t-rex wakes up

00:15:12.030 00:15:13.340
they're like oh well we're in the water

00:15:13.740 00:15:15.980
so we should be fine boom the Rex gets

00:15:16.140 00:15:18.350
in the water and swims at them like a

00:15:18.780 00:15:20.570
crocodile and they were helpless to stop

00:15:21.030 00:15:22.880
it until baby Rex shows up and then

00:15:23.220 00:15:24.530
claims the prey of the big Rex that was

00:15:24.690 00:15:25.639
right there on the bay as its

00:15:25.769 00:15:27.859
oan and the big works like what no I got

00:15:28.110 00:15:29.420
that so he leaves the kids in grant

00:15:29.670 00:15:31.460
alone and chases the baby Rex away and

00:15:31.680 00:15:33.530
so like it's like a close call but it's

00:15:33.839 00:15:36.319
such an incredibly intense scene and as

00:15:36.449 00:15:37.639
they go down the river they go through

00:15:37.769 00:15:40.009
the aviary and face the pterodactyls and

00:15:40.079 00:15:41.840
all that stuff all the while I'm reading

00:15:41.939 00:15:43.579
in this and all of that is intense all

00:15:43.889 00:15:46.160
by itself but I'm like Alan look at your

00:15:46.350 00:15:48.410
watch how long was that rex attack how

00:15:48.689 00:15:50.480
long was the pterodactyl attack how much

00:15:50.790 00:15:52.340
time do you have left to get in there

00:15:52.529 00:15:54.499
and call the boat back so the idea that

00:15:54.990 00:15:57.169
grant had to call this boat back added

00:15:57.749 00:16:00.139
so much to the intensity of all the

00:16:00.449 00:16:02.059
scenes that were going on because he's

00:16:02.249 00:16:03.980
got a mission we got to turn the boat

00:16:05.009 00:16:07.069
before the Raptors reach the mainland

00:16:07.259 00:16:09.859
and so it just added this whole intense

00:16:10.259 00:16:11.590
covering it was such an intense thing

00:16:12.600 00:16:13.669
speaking of intense if I could say that

00:16:13.980 00:16:15.710
50 more times last but never least I

00:16:15.839 00:16:17.600
have to talk about the Raptors because

00:16:17.730 00:16:19.189
the way Michael Crichton described them

00:16:19.410 00:16:22.519
and their intelligence it's just freaky

00:16:22.740 00:16:24.530
I mean the movie did a great job

00:16:25.199 00:16:26.150
portraying it and they've done a good

00:16:26.550 00:16:28.069
I think portraying the Raptors as it's

00:16:28.319 00:16:30.650
going on but man nothing quite reaches

00:16:30.809 00:16:32.269
what Michael Crichton described in the

00:16:32.459 00:16:33.290
books and it's not just their

00:16:33.899 00:16:35.210
intelligence it's the way Michael

00:16:35.699 00:16:37.040
Crichton described all the scenes with

00:16:37.259 00:16:38.299
them I mean for instance you know the

00:16:38.610 00:16:39.980
kitchen scene in Jurassic Park where

00:16:40.529 00:16:41.480
Lexington are in the kitchen and they're

00:16:41.670 00:16:42.889
trying to hide from the two raptors that

00:16:43.019 00:16:44.569
are in there well in the novel is just

00:16:44.790 00:16:46.850
one Raptor but the power's out so the

00:16:47.249 00:16:48.889
kitchen's pitch-black Solex being a

00:16:49.139 00:16:50.720
little girl once flippin ice cream

00:16:51.179 00:16:52.100
grants out trying to get the power back

00:16:52.290 00:16:53.780
on there there alone because it's

00:16:54.029 00:16:56.210
supposed to be the safest place and so

00:16:56.490 00:16:57.559
Tim's trying to get our ice cream he's

00:16:57.749 00:16:59.179
got his night-vision goggles still so

00:16:59.339 00:17:00.410
he's walking in a pitch-black room

00:17:01.259 00:17:02.329
guiding Lex through it wearing his

00:17:02.550 00:17:03.860
night-vision goggles looking for ice

00:17:04.230 00:17:07.250
cream and then they hear a and in the

00:17:07.439 00:17:09.439
pitch darkness there is a raptor in the

00:17:09.870 00:17:11.510
kitchen with them and the fact that it's

00:17:11.819 00:17:14.779
pitch dark adds so much to it and adds

00:17:15.089 00:17:16.850
so much that Lex can't see it but she

00:17:17.069 00:17:18.649
can hear it and the fear that she's

00:17:18.899 00:17:20.510
feeling you have Tim who's the only one

00:17:20.669 00:17:21.769
that could really see in the room and he

00:17:22.020 00:17:23.149
sees where the Raptor is so he's trying

00:17:23.220 00:17:25.399
to lay out frozen steaks to lead the

00:17:25.709 00:17:27.110
Raptor into the giant freezer to save

00:17:27.360 00:17:29.299
him in his sister and and he's trying to

00:17:29.520 00:17:31.190
do it in such a way that he doesn't make

00:17:31.230 00:17:32.930
a noise so that the Raptor can pinpoint

00:17:33.390 00:17:35.450
exactly where he is and go for him and

00:17:36.000 00:17:37.220
then it's the same thing like going on

00:17:37.470 00:17:39.450
outside you have Ellie who's trying

00:17:39.520 00:17:41.700
you distract the Raptors you know she's

00:17:41.830 00:17:42.870
on one side of the fence they're on the

00:17:42.970 00:17:44.250
other she's trying to distract the

00:17:44.649 00:17:45.990
Raptors so that they could accomplish

00:17:46.360 00:17:47.820
something but in reality the Raptors are

00:17:48.100 00:17:49.740
playing with her trying to distract her

00:17:50.020 00:17:52.080
so that the Raptors that have climbed up

00:17:52.240 00:17:53.549
a tree and are on the roof of the

00:17:53.830 00:17:55.169
building can dive down and eat the

00:17:55.360 00:17:57.269
people that are there and so here the

00:17:57.700 00:17:58.649
humans are thinking they're being clever

00:17:59.169 00:18:00.480
and they're distracting the Raptors but

00:18:00.549 00:18:03.180
the Raptors are like oh cool so you I

00:18:03.370 00:18:04.950
can hold your attention to two can play

00:18:05.049 00:18:05.580
at this game

00:18:05.890 00:18:08.310
and that describes the whole island as

00:18:08.710 00:18:09.899
volcanic and so a lot of times there's a

00:18:10.240 00:18:11.490
Miss that just kind of remains over the

00:18:11.980 00:18:13.350
island so the mist is kind of its own

00:18:13.990 00:18:15.330
character with you know the silhouettes

00:18:15.429 00:18:16.680
of the Raptors in the mist you can't see

00:18:16.840 00:18:18.240
where they are boom there it is and like

00:18:18.490 00:18:20.610
Oh Mike I don't even know how much more

00:18:20.770 00:18:21.810
to describe it like it's one of those

00:18:21.970 00:18:23.100
things you just have to read yourself

00:18:23.500 00:18:25.470
the way Michael Crichton wrote it and

00:18:25.750 00:18:27.269
used the environment the intelligence of

00:18:27.460 00:18:28.529
the animals and their coordinated

00:18:28.990 00:18:31.049
attacks it was just absolutely

00:18:32.279 00:18:34.230
incredible there's so much more I could

00:18:34.510 00:18:35.789
talk about there's so much more that I

00:18:36.039 00:18:37.680
can say but you know what as much as

00:18:37.840 00:18:39.659
this has been a spoiler talk I do want

00:18:39.730 00:18:41.340
