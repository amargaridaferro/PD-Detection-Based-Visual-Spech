00:00:09.370 00:00:10.740
today I'm going to address the question

00:00:10.930 00:00:13.589
of what's a good basic oral hygiene

00:00:14.580 00:00:17.310
program now once again this is not one

00:00:17.590 00:00:19.680
size fits all we need to tailor

00:00:20.350 00:00:22.230
something specifically to what your

00:00:22.600 00:00:24.870
needs are but let's just do some

00:00:25.650 00:00:28.050
generalities the first thing which I

00:00:28.390 00:00:31.109
work together with my ot and my PT on is

00:00:31.660 00:00:34.950
getting a good position for doing the

00:00:35.320 00:00:39.389
oral hygiene program it's important not

00:00:39.460 00:00:44.280
to try the multitask and when I you know

00:00:44.710 00:00:47.660
sometimes you think of multitasking as

00:00:48.670 00:00:51.990
driving and looking at your phone okay

00:00:52.270 00:00:54.170
well that's not what we're talking about

00:00:55.180 00:00:57.029
multitasking can be just keeping your

00:00:57.719 00:00:59.819
balance while you're brushing your teeth

00:01:00.430 00:01:03.660
and it takes a lot of effort to keep

00:01:03.969 00:01:05.519
that balance you're needing to

00:01:06.310 00:01:10.739
concentrate on this not on this so first

00:01:10.959 00:01:12.449
thing I want you to think about is

00:01:13.420 00:01:14.639
possibly you're the type that needs to

00:01:14.979 00:01:18.539
sit in your chair or in in a chair in a

00:01:19.029 00:01:21.449
wheelchair possibly but sit to do your

00:01:21.999 00:01:25.019
oral hygiene so let's take a look at at

00:01:25.270 00:01:28.349
your feet there's a real tendency to

00:01:29.049 00:01:30.929
stand with your feet too close together

00:01:31.499 00:01:34.980
and already when I'm doing that it's

00:01:35.259 00:01:37.260
hard for me to keep my balance when my

00:01:37.539 00:01:39.539
feet are that close together I need a

00:01:39.849 00:01:43.010
good base of support in order to stand

00:01:44.020 00:01:47.279
so my ot and Pt have helped me figure

00:01:47.590 00:01:49.709
out that it's good to put that tape on

00:01:49.899 00:01:53.219
the floor in a position that is is a

00:01:53.590 00:01:56.219
good sturdy base of support for you put

00:01:56.349 00:01:57.690
it there so that you don't even have to

00:01:57.729 00:02:01.049
think about it now you've got two points

00:02:01.179 00:02:03.599
of contact that might be all you need

00:02:04.509 00:02:07.199
but what can be even better hate to have

00:02:07.270 00:02:07.970
to have

00:02:08.130 00:02:11.590
look at my stomach but brace yourself

00:02:12.600 00:02:15.290
against the counter now you've got three

00:02:15.510 00:02:18.560
points of contact I feeling so solid I'm

00:02:18.720 00:02:20.210
not even having to think about my

00:02:20.670 00:02:23.030
balance so now all I have to concentrate

00:02:23.310 00:02:25.390
on is brushing my teeth

00:02:26.400 00:02:28.880
okay so now what is the basic oral

00:02:29.370 00:02:31.490
hygiene program sir there are certain

00:02:31.740 00:02:34.070
things that I want you to do three times

00:02:34.440 00:02:38.840
a day ideally after each meal first you

00:02:39.030 00:02:41.030
want to start with just rinsing out your

00:02:41.900 00:02:43.760
mouth all right what we know about

00:02:44.610 00:02:46.460
Parkinson's is I talked about how

00:02:47.160 00:02:49.040
wonderful the tongue is but you tend to

00:02:49.290 00:02:51.650
have a little reduced range of motion or

00:02:52.350 00:02:54.650
amplitude of movement with that tongue

00:02:55.560 00:02:57.850
to clear out all the little crevices and

00:02:58.860 00:03:01.340
crannies that are in your mouth so if

00:03:01.650 00:03:05.020
you start by taking a drink of water

00:03:06.030 00:03:08.350
swishing it around and spitting that out

00:03:09.360 00:03:11.150
you're likely going to see a number of

00:03:11.370 00:03:14.420
food particles so keep doing that keep

00:03:14.790 00:03:16.910
doing the switch and the spit until it's

00:03:17.310 00:03:19.610
coming out clean if you don't start with

00:03:19.800 00:03:21.730
that when you're brushing your teeth

00:03:22.740 00:03:25.040
you're just grinding all that food into

00:03:25.530 00:03:27.100
your teeth and that's not the goal of

00:03:28.110 00:03:29.990
what we're trying to do here so now

00:03:30.239 00:03:33.320
let's talk about brushing I'm going to

00:03:33.480 00:03:35.120
recommend brushing with an electric

00:03:35.700 00:03:38.000
toothbrush it just makes things simpler

00:03:38.250 00:03:40.360
and it does so much of the work for you

00:03:41.370 00:03:43.910
but keep in mind now we've got our good

00:03:44.400 00:03:46.460
stance up to the counter we're all

00:03:47.190 00:03:48.590
supported you're going to need to work

00:03:49.050 00:03:52.010
one tooth at a time you've got a plan

00:03:52.500 00:03:54.170
and you've got to concentrate while

00:03:54.330 00:03:58.100
you're doing this so luckily the

00:03:58.620 00:04:00.320
electric toothbrush has the little beeps

00:04:00.720 00:04:02.210
that let you know when you're done with

00:04:02.370 00:04:05.330
each quadrant so start get a pattern I

00:04:05.489 00:04:07.309
don't care what your pattern is I saw

00:04:07.499 00:04:11.420
with that back right front tooth and I

00:04:11.670 00:04:13.759
work one at a time all the way to the

00:04:14.040 00:04:16.729
front then I do the top all the way to

00:04:16.919 00:04:19.460
the back then I come back oh look at

00:04:19.680 00:04:22.099
this I got to do some arm and some wrist

00:04:22.470 00:04:24.620
and some movement here make sure your

00:04:24.990 00:04:26.420
hands doing that movement make sure

00:04:26.610 00:04:29.390
you're getting back to that back tooth

00:04:29.820 00:04:32.300
again on the inside and bring it all the

00:04:32.580 00:04:34.730
way to the front you're done with that

00:04:35.460 00:04:37.010
quadrant it's going to beep now you're

00:04:37.139 00:04:39.589
going to move on to the next quadrant so

00:04:40.470 00:04:41.870
this is going to be a good friend for

00:04:43.520 00:04:46.670
you alright those just swish and spit

00:04:47.039 00:04:49.460
and then brush your teeth three times a

00:04:49.500 00:04:51.439
day that's really going to help with

00:04:51.870 00:04:54.230
keeping the flora and everything in your

00:04:54.449 00:04:56.659
mouth good and clean now there are some

00:04:56.729 00:04:59.089
things I want you to do once a day let's

00:04:59.310 00:05:01.249
look at some of the tools we're going to

00:05:01.440 00:05:02.529
use for that

00:05:03.539 00:05:05.029
alright let's talk about some things

00:05:05.340 00:05:07.520
that I'd like for you to do once a day I

00:05:07.919 00:05:09.770
don't care when you do it whenever it

00:05:10.020 00:05:11.719
fits into your schedule but try to make

00:05:11.880 00:05:14.480
a routine and do it at that same time

00:05:14.849 00:05:15.550
each day

00:05:16.789 00:05:19.460
so ideally we'd like for you to floss I

00:05:19.889 00:05:21.499
don't care what type of gloss you use

00:05:22.229 00:05:26.270
but lost once a day there's the

00:05:26.610 00:05:29.029
traditional thoughts there are these

00:05:29.460 00:05:33.740
wonderful little floss picks that can be

00:05:33.990 00:05:36.529
even handy or for you or if you just

00:05:37.050 00:05:41.060
find that flossing is too tricky maybe

00:05:41.370 00:05:43.339
use some of these little picks that you

00:05:43.560 00:05:46.760
can get in and get in between each tooth

00:05:47.159 00:05:49.640
and get the little extra particles out

00:05:49.830 00:05:52.399
of there what's key and what you're

00:05:52.680 00:05:56.779
working to do is to disrupt the those

00:05:57.630 00:05:58.640
materials that aren't supposed to be

00:05:58.919 00:06:01.850
there so that they don't solidify and

00:06:02.670 00:06:05.030
create the plaque and things that are

00:06:05.580 00:06:08.500
bad for your mouth here's another type

00:06:09.510 00:06:11.630
these are called they have different

00:06:12.420 00:06:13.700
different types of them this one's

00:06:13.890 00:06:15.740
called den Tech and I want you to be

00:06:15.990 00:06:18.320
aware that if you have really tight

00:06:18.660 00:06:21.080
teeth like I do they make one for those

00:06:21.630 00:06:24.350
tighter teeth or if you have more gapi

00:06:24.600 00:06:27.500
teeth then you want to get a little

00:06:27.870 00:06:31.010
different style or it's the same thing

00:06:31.200 00:06:34.760
it's just forgot your key all right so

00:06:35.520 00:06:37.460
this is where I like to refer folks to

00:06:37.620 00:06:39.500
my occupational therapists they're the

00:06:39.720 00:06:41.750
ones that are really good at seeing how

00:06:41.970 00:06:44.300
is your motor movement how well are you

00:06:44.670 00:06:47.180
how well are you able to move your hands

00:06:47.430 00:06:49.730
around and get the jobs done here that

00:06:50.250 00:06:52.280
that you really need to get done so I'm

00:06:52.520 00:06:56.090
not condoning any particular one and I'm

00:06:56.360 00:06:58.520
not definitely not saying a particular

00:06:59.100 00:07:01.490
brand is best it just depends on what

00:07:01.770 00:07:04.820
works good for you here's something I

00:07:05.220 00:07:07.970
like to keep in my purse or in the car

00:07:08.580 00:07:09.710
it's great for when you're traveling

00:07:10.350 00:07:12.770
around as we talked about you're likely

00:07:13.110 00:07:15.680
going to have some extra particles left

00:07:16.169 00:07:18.950
over when you're done eating so these

00:07:19.169 00:07:20.210
are really good it's like a little

00:07:20.400 00:07:22.130
portable toothbrush you can get in there

00:07:22.410 00:07:26.240
and and get get those get the food out

00:07:26.280 00:07:28.820
of all those little crevices and make

00:07:29.220 00:07:30.680
yourself feel really fresh and clean

00:07:31.560 00:07:32.810
it's going to help you to be able to

00:07:33.090 00:07:36.020
talk and have conversations afterward if

00:07:36.210 00:07:37.430
you're dealing with trying to keep your

00:07:37.620 00:07:39.430
stuff in your mouth that's just gonna be

00:07:40.440 00:07:44.450
distracting and annoying alright so we

00:07:44.730 00:07:47.900
talked about flossing next I want to

00:07:48.060 00:07:50.630
make sure that you use a toothbrush you

00:07:50.850 00:07:52.610
want to use a soft bristle toothbrush

00:07:52.950 00:07:55.790
and again this is just once a day Bluffs

00:07:56.190 00:08:00.740
and then use a toothbrush to to scrub

00:08:01.200 00:08:03.560
all the tissue in your mouth I'm not

00:08:04.110 00:08:06.200
talking about the teeth of course you do

00:08:06.390 00:08:09.050
that pretty naturally but it's important

00:08:09.240 00:08:13.219
to disrupt all the tissue get in there

00:08:13.350 00:08:15.890
and get the guns you want to get into

00:08:16.020 00:08:21.020
the cheeks you got to do the tongue the

00:08:21.300 00:08:24.409
roof of your mouth get all in there

00:08:25.229 00:08:27.710
under the tongue get in there

00:08:28.320 00:08:31.460
you've got no this is what's important

00:08:31.530 00:08:32.990
about this this is why I tell you to do

00:08:33.120 00:08:36.170
it it's gonna feel really weird but what

00:08:36.330 00:08:40.520
we know is that aspiration pneumonia is

00:08:41.070 00:08:43.100
going to be more common in folks that

00:08:43.349 00:08:46.340
have bad bacteria in their mouth and the

00:08:46.980 00:08:48.650
bacteria doesn't just form on the teeth

00:08:49.170 00:08:51.829
it forms on all the tissues so if we

00:08:52.170 00:08:54.079
disrupt those tissues and make those

00:08:54.600 00:08:57.410
tissues play off then they will create

00:08:57.750 00:09:01.070
new and healthy tissue and and keep your

00:09:01.260 00:09:04.699
mouth really clean and and healthy and

00:09:05.220 00:09:10.130
safer for swallowing so you flossed you

00:09:10.589 00:09:12.470
disrupt it all the tissue in your mouth

00:09:12.780 00:09:14.900
with a toothbrush the last thing I'm

00:09:15.060 00:09:21.110
going to do is use some mouthwash or

00:09:21.420 00:09:25.160
mouth rinse that does not have alcohol

00:09:25.380 00:09:28.730
in it that's the guideline and I often

00:09:28.950 00:09:31.280
recommend this particular brand which is

00:09:32.100 00:09:34.310
biotene because it can be soothing for

00:09:34.650 00:09:36.800
people with dry mouth even though you

00:09:37.140 00:09:39.890
may have what you feel like is excessive

00:09:40.440 00:09:43.010
saliva at the same time you can feel as

00:09:43.290 00:09:45.470
though you're actually pretty dry in

00:09:45.630 00:09:52.449
your mouth so take a little sip of that

00:09:53.900 00:09:56.420
and then spit it out and then you're

00:09:56.640 00:10:00.410
done for the day all right one more

00:10:00.600 00:10:03.500
little tip and that is regular dental

00:10:04.250 00:10:07.250
visits maybe you're okay with just two

00:10:07.560 00:10:09.260
times a year which is just the standard

00:10:10.250 00:10:12.949
guideline but I often find for my folks

00:10:13.140 00:10:14.210
with Parkinson's

00:10:14.310 00:10:16.490
it's really helpful to go three times a

00:10:16.800 00:10:19.990
year so every four months or maybe even

00:10:21.000 00:10:22.880
four times a year which is every three

00:10:23.160 00:10:25.400
months and your dentist and your

00:10:26.310 00:10:27.500
hygienists should be able to kind of

00:10:27.660 00:10:30.320
have a sense to guide you as far as how

00:10:30.690 00:10:32.450
quickly is plaque building up on your

00:10:32.730 00:10:34.940
teeth and how frequently do you need to
