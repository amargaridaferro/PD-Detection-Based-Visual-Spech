00:00:07.230 00:00:09.470
hi my name is dr. John Lawrence and I'm

00:00:09.540 00:00:12.379
a chiropractic neurologist and I work at

00:00:12.840 00:00:14.330
advanced rejuvenation we're part of a

00:00:15.299 00:00:17.300
clinical team that includes acupuncture

00:00:18.170 00:00:20.810
medical my self chiropractic neurology

00:00:21.170 00:00:24.800
and we work as a team to provide some of

00:00:24.960 00:00:26.990
the most cutting-edge and advanced

00:00:27.630 00:00:29.240
alternative care for neurological

00:00:29.730 00:00:31.970
conditions such as Parkinson's and

00:00:32.099 00:00:35.350
Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injuries

00:00:36.360 00:00:38.690
vestibular disorders I would invite you

00:00:38.730 00:00:41.389
to take a look at some of the different

00:00:42.000 00:00:43.549
procedures that we do here I'd like to

00:00:43.800 00:00:48.139
just kind of touch on a few extremely

00:00:48.750 00:00:49.970
exciting cutting-edge things that we're

00:00:50.910 00:00:53.119
doing here at advanced rejuvenation one

00:00:53.219 00:00:54.709
of the things that I think is really

00:00:55.110 00:00:57.830
important to understand with Parkinson's

00:00:58.079 00:01:01.849
in particular is that these people tend

00:01:02.010 00:01:04.119
to lose the dopamine producing cells

00:01:05.129 00:01:06.500
particularly in an area in their basal

00:01:07.110 00:01:09.910
ganglia called the substantia now

00:01:10.920 00:01:14.359
the the sufferer of Parkinson's will

00:01:14.700 00:01:16.580
begin to have things like slowness of

00:01:16.670 00:01:18.890
movement though they call that brady

00:01:19.140 00:01:21.109
kinesia and they'll also start to get

00:01:21.689 00:01:26.330
what's called tremors and so besides the

00:01:26.790 00:01:28.310
slowness of movement and the tremors

00:01:28.500 00:01:30.649
they'll also have freezing so they'll be

00:01:31.200 00:01:32.480
walking and they'll kind of come to a

00:01:32.790 00:01:34.010
doorway a lot of times and then just

00:01:34.110 00:01:36.260
they won't be able to move and then

00:01:36.509 00:01:38.300
there's shuffling gait is also something

00:01:38.490 00:01:39.830
that you'll see with Parkinson's and

00:01:40.409 00:01:44.330
these are all symptoms related to low

00:01:44.909 00:01:47.060
dopamine levels in the brain so what are

00:01:47.369 00:01:49.819
ways that we can naturally get dopamine

00:01:50.130 00:01:52.520
to be elevated in in a brain that's

00:01:53.100 00:01:53.870
suffering from the disease of

00:01:54.600 00:01:57.380
Parkinson's well one of the most

00:01:57.719 00:01:59.149
exciting things that we've begun doing

00:01:59.520 00:02:01.160
here at the Vance rejuvenation is using

00:02:01.320 00:02:05.149
a substance called nad now nad is short

00:02:05.520 00:02:07.740
for nicotinamide adenine

00:02:07.930 00:02:11.220
Liat ID and nad has a long history of

00:02:11.770 00:02:14.820
use for patients with low dopamine

00:02:15.280 00:02:18.030
levels and particularly quite a history

00:02:18.310 00:02:20.970
with addiction because most addictions

00:02:21.190 00:02:23.010
have something to do with dopamine and

00:02:23.590 00:02:24.900
so addiction centers will often use

00:02:25.300 00:02:28.530
these nad infusions to reestablish nor

00:02:28.959 00:02:31.140
normal dopamine but here in advanced

00:02:31.810 00:02:33.150
rejuvenation we've actually found that

00:02:33.940 00:02:35.490
this can be very exciting for someone

00:02:35.709 00:02:37.560
suffering from Parkinson's disease now

00:02:37.720 00:02:41.729
how does it work well nad is a substance

00:02:41.860 00:02:45.420
that is very important to catalyze most

00:02:46.090 00:02:48.510
enzyme activations and like I've written

00:02:48.970 00:02:51.090
here there's an enzyme that's called

00:02:51.610 00:02:57.060
tyrosine hydroxylase ox amine is the

00:02:57.489 00:02:59.030
enzyme that's responsible for converting

00:03:00.040 00:03:03.330
tyrosine to dopamine and this enzyme is

00:03:03.640 00:03:06.270
a huge problem for most people with

00:03:06.910 00:03:08.640
Parkinson's disease and so this is

00:03:09.220 00:03:10.949
actually at the root cause of low

00:03:11.350 00:03:13.590
dopamine levels besides the degradation

00:03:14.200 00:03:16.500
of the cells in the substantia and

00:03:17.080 00:03:19.410
so by up regulating the conversion of

00:03:19.930 00:03:21.810
tyrosine into dopamine the patient can

00:03:22.090 00:03:24.000
start to get more of their own dopamine

00:03:24.340 00:03:26.370
production back into place and when you

00:03:26.530 00:03:28.710
get more of your own dopamine then

00:03:28.989 00:03:31.229
there's less of a need for the dopamine

00:03:32.080 00:03:33.830
medications which is very exciting

00:03:36.090 00:03:38.759
so nad infusions are very exciting it's

00:03:39.040 00:03:42.479
one of the different treatment

00:03:43.090 00:03:44.569
modalities that we use here for

00:03:45.579 00:03:47.250
Parkinson's disease another treatment

00:03:47.950 00:03:49.410
modality that we've been using here at

00:03:49.780 00:03:51.000
advanced rejuvenation is something that

00:03:51.040 00:03:51.960
I do personally

00:03:52.390 00:03:54.449
it's called functional crane release now

00:03:55.209 00:03:58.620
what's really important is when when

00:03:59.670 00:04:02.640
Parkinson's hits the brain it starts to

00:04:02.890 00:04:04.770
affect a lot of different generators

00:04:05.739 00:04:09.960
which relate to eye movements and the

00:04:10.450 00:04:11.910
ability for the eyes to move properly

00:04:12.519 00:04:15.809
not the eyes having proper visual acuity

00:04:16.299 00:04:18.570
but their movements one of them is

00:04:18.760 00:04:20.590
called a saccade which is a

00:04:20.810 00:04:22.270
fast eye movement and another one is a

00:04:22.850 00:04:24.520
pursuit and a lot of these have

00:04:25.250 00:04:28.330
generators in the deep brain stem and

00:04:28.520 00:04:30.160
these are affected with Parkinson's and

00:04:30.320 00:04:32.680
we can see these with tests that we run

00:04:33.200 00:04:35.020
called a Sakon ometer will see something

00:04:35.270 00:04:37.570
called an omni paws intrusion and this

00:04:37.820 00:04:39.570
has to do with that substantial Niagra

00:04:40.580 00:04:42.910
not allowing cicadas to be normal so

00:04:43.790 00:04:45.550
what will happen is the eyes won't be

00:04:45.680 00:04:48.850
able to make normal fast movements and

00:04:49.220 00:04:50.830
it's only something that's detectable

00:04:51.440 00:04:53.620
with a test like a sacca domitor you

00:04:53.930 00:04:54.940
can't see this very well

00:04:56.050 00:04:58.780
visually however this can make drastic

00:04:59.750 00:05:03.190
negative impacts to someone's brain that

00:05:03.380 00:05:05.590
has Parkinson's in particular something

00:05:05.960 00:05:09.250
called colliculi Maps now I haven't seen

00:05:09.440 00:05:11.140
a Parkinson's patient that didn't have

00:05:11.300 00:05:13.420
an issue with poor colliculus but

00:05:13.850 00:05:14.890
basically this is what it is

00:05:15.350 00:05:16.960
these are grids that you make of your

00:05:17.360 00:05:20.590
body and the environment and you need an

00:05:20.990 00:05:23.380
accurate eye movement that goes to a

00:05:23.990 00:05:26.530
target and hold your eye on a target for

00:05:26.660 00:05:28.390
at least a moment in order to build

00:05:28.700 00:05:31.660
these maps otherwise what happens is you

00:05:31.790 00:05:33.730
get an expansion of your colliculi maps

00:05:34.100 00:05:36.580
and what that means to you if you if

00:05:36.770 00:05:38.140
you're dealing with Parkinson's is that

00:05:38.510 00:05:40.710
instead of you having a very specific

00:05:41.980 00:05:44.230
delineated idea or map in your head of

00:05:44.390 00:05:46.900
your shoulder or a finger joint or your

00:05:47.270 00:05:49.390
wrist or your neck and all the different

00:05:49.550 00:05:51.610
levels in your neck these are expanded

00:05:51.800 00:05:53.770
and so instead of just being able to

00:05:54.080 00:05:55.900
move the shoulder joint things will

00:05:56.180 00:06:00.610
start to move more together and so this

00:06:00.890 00:06:03.370
has a negative impact on a lot of the

00:06:03.890 00:06:05.920
tightness that you feel in Parkinson's a

00:06:06.080 00:06:08.350
lot of times patients necks are tight

00:06:08.630 00:06:09.880
their shoulders are tight a lot of their

00:06:10.340 00:06:11.890
muscles become very rigid and tight and

00:06:12.290 00:06:13.570
a lot of this has to do with these

00:06:14.540 00:06:17.110
colliculi Maps becoming expanded it'd be

00:06:17.360 00:06:18.700
kind of like if you took a picture and

00:06:18.830 00:06:21.370
you had a slow shutter speed and the

00:06:21.770 00:06:22.900
picture kind of got smeared on the

00:06:23.390 00:06:25.000
picture this is what the brain starts to

00:06:25.190 00:06:28.150
perceive now I'm talking about this in

00:06:28.490 00:06:29.860
particularly because this is a huge part

00:06:30.110 00:06:32.050
of what we look at but it's

00:06:32.270 00:06:34.840
of many areas functionally that we might

00:06:35.090 00:06:36.330
look at with someone with Parkinson's

00:06:37.340 00:06:39.130
where we can start act actively

00:06:39.890 00:06:41.820
activating the brain with specific

00:06:42.830 00:06:44.740
manipulations and exercises to basically

00:06:45.650 00:06:47.080
re-establish these colliculus they're

00:06:47.480 00:06:48.790
actually very easy to fix

00:06:49.130 00:06:51.730
they they they clear up very quickly and

00:06:52.070 00:06:53.920
they update very quickly so it's a very

00:06:54.230 00:06:58.690
very powerful way to improve someone's

00:06:59.090 00:07:00.670
brain function without any drugs and not

00:07:01.040 00:07:02.530
without any surgery so that's very

00:07:03.340 00:07:05.620
exciting so we do utilize something

00:07:05.960 00:07:07.600
called functional chiropractic neurology

00:07:07.730 00:07:09.160
and I would invite you to take a look at

00:07:10.040 00:07:11.590
functional cranium release comm and look

00:07:11.720 00:07:13.570
at some of the different videos or some

00:07:13.700 00:07:15.400
of the information I might have online

00:07:15.680 00:07:17.290
about Parkinson's and the use

00:07:18.170 00:07:18.790
functionally with some of these

00:07:19.250 00:07:20.410
different specific neurological

00:07:21.380 00:07:23.620
exercises and again I always do a free
