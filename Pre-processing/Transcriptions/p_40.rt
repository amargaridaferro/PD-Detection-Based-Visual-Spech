00:00:01.620 00:00:03.560
hello everybody my name is serene and

00:00:03.810 00:00:06.410
I'm going to take you on my journey with

00:00:07.109 00:00:10.070
Parkinson's disease especially with my

00:00:10.650 00:00:12.110
pregnant sister Parkinson's disease

00:00:12.740 00:00:16.580
recovery journey I am NOT attempting to

00:00:16.920 00:00:18.830
live with Parkinson's this way the way

00:00:19.050 00:00:21.370
it is right now actually I intend to

00:00:22.380 00:00:24.410
live with Parkinson's in a way that I

00:00:24.900 00:00:27.410
take it as a signal when I'm going on

00:00:27.900 00:00:31.970
down the wrong path and I will explain

00:00:32.219 00:00:35.120
about this later first of all I want to

00:00:35.640 00:00:38.360
show you what specific type Parkinson's

00:00:38.489 00:00:43.130
I have I early onset Parkinson's as well

00:00:43.379 00:00:45.049
as both of my sisters still my little

00:00:45.480 00:00:47.240
sister was diagnosed when she was 21 and

00:00:47.899 00:00:50.750
I was diagnosed when I was 29 and my

00:00:51.120 00:00:52.310
older sister is somewhere in between

00:00:52.530 00:00:56.540
that and my diagnosis is written here

00:00:56.730 00:00:58.310
it's I don't know if you can tell here

00:00:58.879 00:01:04.759
it's part 2 mutation that's what it's

00:01:04.979 00:01:07.820
called that it says other stuff on here

00:01:08.040 00:01:10.399
and but I think it's too complicated for

00:01:10.770 00:01:15.969
any one of us who are not medically very

00:01:16.979 00:01:20.330
interested or very educated and anyways

00:01:20.610 00:01:22.550
I just wanted to show you what kind of

00:01:23.070 00:01:25.010
Parkinson's has been diagnosed and me

00:01:25.619 00:01:29.510
how this looks on my paper and yeah and

00:01:30.180 00:01:32.840
what's next I wanted to tell you what my

00:01:33.659 00:01:35.510
point is right now how it got here where

00:01:35.549 00:01:41.569
I am today actually I was 28 or so when

00:01:41.610 00:01:44.749
I first started noticing and a lot of

00:01:45.659 00:01:47.620
cramping and shaking in my wake I

00:01:48.630 00:01:50.240
actually thought at this time that this

00:01:50.820 00:01:53.889
was the read the reason for that was and

00:01:54.899 00:01:57.280
that I have been doing very much

00:01:58.310 00:02:01.899
activity sports activity like running

00:02:01.939 00:02:04.779
I had my horse that I was taking care of

00:02:05.299 00:02:08.440
and walking with him a lot every day and

00:02:08.750 00:02:10.089
besides that still do a lot of sports

00:02:10.459 00:02:12.430
high-intensity interval training and

00:02:12.800 00:02:15.790
running like I said and other things and

00:02:15.920 00:02:17.259
I just kind of figured it might be a

00:02:17.989 00:02:20.020
magnesium deficiency but in the back of

00:02:20.120 00:02:23.410
my head I kind of was thinking that it

00:02:23.660 00:02:26.559
might go down the same path as it goes

00:02:26.870 00:02:28.270
for most both of my sister's that

00:02:28.840 00:02:32.229
already Warren he had their diagnosis so

00:02:32.720 00:02:37.539
anyways when I was 29 I I really could

00:02:37.670 00:02:39.759
not have myself with them with magnesium

00:02:40.760 00:02:42.610
and other supplements so I figured I

00:02:42.650 00:02:45.490
should probably test myself as well so I

00:02:45.860 00:02:46.900
don't miss anything

00:02:47.920 00:02:50.680
um while I'm not doing anything for my

00:02:50.959 00:02:53.500
health I figured if I would knew know

00:02:54.140 00:02:54.880
what is going on

00:02:55.010 00:02:58.210
I could make take specific steps to

00:02:58.430 00:02:59.860
better this situation instead of

00:03:00.650 00:03:02.470
ignoring it until it's too late and I

00:03:02.750 00:03:04.390
cannot fix anything anymore that was

00:03:04.670 00:03:06.370
really important for me to know it as

00:03:06.709 00:03:08.860
early as possible and to still have a

00:03:09.170 00:03:16.650
chance to fix some of it yeah this time

00:03:17.660 00:03:20.110
when I drink this time when I started

00:03:20.569 00:03:21.309
shaking and just started showing

00:03:21.650 00:03:25.349
symptoms and lack of concentration and

00:03:26.359 00:03:30.569
yeah just over overall tiredness and

00:03:31.579 00:03:36.280
stuff like that I was actually also in a

00:03:36.410 00:03:39.360
very stressful situation at work and

00:03:40.370 00:03:41.650
there are other things going around

00:03:42.380 00:03:44.319
going on around me like my sister was

00:03:44.690 00:03:46.720
versus struggling very hard with her

00:03:47.630 00:03:49.840
Parkinson's disease she was 21 and they

00:03:50.150 00:03:52.090
wanted to make her brain give her brain

00:03:52.639 00:03:55.300
surgery after she had like 14 or 15

00:03:55.579 00:03:57.940
pills a day and did not work and just

00:03:58.190 00:04:00.940
messed her up even more and I was really

00:04:04.450 00:04:06.119
scared what was going to happen to her

00:04:06.550 00:04:08.460
because she was also mentally getting

00:04:09.450 00:04:12.839
worse it was quite tough for her to push

00:04:13.420 00:04:16.319
through this struggle and it was

00:04:16.989 00:04:19.289
something that was on my shoulders as

00:04:19.329 00:04:22.550
well thus worrying about my sisters and

00:04:23.560 00:04:25.230
this and in addition to that the

00:04:25.540 00:04:27.270
stressful situation and worked a very

00:04:27.669 00:04:30.270
stressful situation and I even got in

00:04:30.430 00:04:32.550
the situation where they started telling

00:04:32.860 00:04:36.120
lies about me another person told my

00:04:36.310 00:04:38.490
boss lies about me and he started

00:04:39.010 00:04:44.010
mobbing me out and yeah was not a very

00:04:44.169 00:04:47.730
nice situation and I am still kind of

00:04:47.979 00:04:52.440
trying to work on this experience I had

00:04:53.410 00:04:55.560
from being pushed away and pushed aside

00:04:56.020 00:04:59.790
and um it still bothers me somewhere in

00:04:59.919 00:05:01.650
my head even though it's a couple of

00:05:01.720 00:05:03.659
years ago now it's still coming back up

00:05:04.930 00:05:06.300
it's like a little mini trauma I

00:05:07.210 00:05:09.840
experienced and when I was like not

00:05:10.840 00:05:13.020
people want didn't want me anymore even

00:05:13.210 00:05:17.960
though I was the best in my job I

00:05:18.970 00:05:22.460
figured it was something personal and I

00:05:23.470 00:05:24.659
figured for myself that I could do

00:05:25.090 00:05:27.390
anything you're perfect but it would

00:05:27.580 00:05:30.090
never be enough and this was not very

00:05:30.310 00:05:31.980
good for my mental health as well and

00:05:32.860 00:05:34.350
from data on my Parkinson's disease

00:05:34.840 00:05:39.260
progressed even even faster than before

00:05:40.270 00:05:44.040
it's got really worse and I was finally

00:05:44.520 00:05:47.430
in total burnout I could not get up from

00:05:47.620 00:05:51.029
my bed I hardly could get up and get

00:05:51.099 00:05:53.460
some food I found a refrigerator and

00:05:54.400 00:05:57.510
then go on a sofa I could not almost not

00:05:57.940 00:06:00.659
climb the stairs I was so weak I was

00:06:01.240 00:06:02.610
totally out of breath and only just

00:06:03.070 00:06:05.300
climbing a little bit of stairs

00:06:05.510 00:06:08.420
and yeah I could not focus anymore I had

00:06:09.330 00:06:12.909
severe anxiety and panic attacks and

00:06:13.919 00:06:15.680
yeah a lot of other things I can go into

00:06:16.370 00:06:18.860
this in another video if you would like

00:06:18.900 00:06:21.460
to know what I have been dealing with

00:06:22.470 00:06:23.930
for some there's some people it might be

00:06:24.330 00:06:25.790
helpful to see that other people are on

00:06:26.340 00:06:27.970
industry as well experienced

00:06:28.980 00:06:31.190
experiencing such things as well so you

00:06:31.380 00:06:32.810
don't feel this alone and your journey

00:06:33.030 00:06:35.030
and if you see people that have gotten

00:06:35.340 00:06:36.860
out of the situation that's even better

00:06:37.440 00:06:39.740
this gives you motivation and security

00:06:40.820 00:06:43.130
and then you are on the right path stand

00:06:43.500 00:06:47.510
and that it is possible for you to get

00:06:48.030 00:06:51.730
better and live a happy life again

00:06:52.740 00:06:55.940
anyways um that's just about me my story

00:06:56.720 00:06:59.690
and what I started doing after this I

00:07:00.060 00:07:02.780
always was interested in medicine and I

00:07:03.530 00:07:06.200
am educated in SF I'm an assistant I

00:07:06.389 00:07:08.440
used to work in an in a pharmacy and

00:07:09.450 00:07:11.780
even how mad I was when I was young and

00:07:13.310 00:07:16.460
my years of learning I already started

00:07:17.100 00:07:20.300
asking and why stuff happens because in

00:07:20.580 00:07:21.890
school they only told us a year there

00:07:22.140 00:07:23.810
are these mean symptoms and you give

00:07:23.970 00:07:27.380
this medicine for that and I kept asking

00:07:27.840 00:07:30.469
but why are the students coming up what

00:07:30.660 00:07:32.570
is it why don't we give something

00:07:33.570 00:07:37.100
against the root cause instead of just

00:07:37.440 00:07:39.920
treating his symptoms and like putting

00:07:40.080 00:07:44.090
on fire we're trying to shut up the fire

00:07:44.580 00:07:47.540
and the fire alarm but if I you're still

00:07:48.419 00:07:50.810
the burning inside I did not understand

00:07:50.970 00:07:54.170
this even when I was like 16 and I was

00:07:54.510 00:07:56.330
very interested and I actually haven't

00:07:56.820 00:07:58.969
quite a bit as a research chunky as well

00:07:59.250 00:08:01.070
I'd love to read and I love to educate

00:08:01.560 00:08:03.529
myself and this has helped me a lot in

00:08:03.810 00:08:06.170
my journey now because this huge

00:08:08.360 00:08:11.559
what is going on in my body and and the

00:08:11.780 00:08:15.450
wish to help myself and my sisters and

00:08:16.460 00:08:19.029
it's bringing me it's pushing me to work

00:08:19.400 00:08:22.240
towards reading a lot and educating

00:08:22.400 00:08:24.670
myself and listening to speeches

00:08:25.580 00:08:27.189
listening to interviews with doctors

00:08:27.620 00:08:30.400
reading doctors books medicine books and

00:08:30.650 00:08:32.860
stuff like this studies that are kind of

00:08:33.260 00:08:35.409
complex to read for someone who is not a

00:08:35.839 00:08:38.170
doctor or a chemist can I come in how

00:08:38.240 00:08:41.139
are you feeling wish you know what I

00:08:41.300 00:08:42.880
mean that works with chemistry is

00:08:45.040 00:08:48.579
something anyways I am doing this a lot

00:08:48.980 00:08:52.060
and I am finding so much information out

00:08:52.130 00:08:53.170
there there's so much information

00:08:53.720 00:08:55.449
there's so many peoples that are

00:08:55.970 00:08:57.130
diagnosed with Parkinson's that got

00:08:57.440 00:09:00.940
better with a lot of easy tricks not all

00:09:01.070 00:09:04.180
of them are easy some of them take a lot

00:09:04.220 00:09:06.730
of effort some of them are actually

00:09:06.950 00:09:09.699
quite easy I think and if we put those

00:09:09.980 00:09:12.910
pieces together even one of us can get

00:09:13.160 00:09:14.920
better and can live a healthier and

00:09:15.140 00:09:20.500
happier life and I see it in myself

00:09:20.690 00:09:23.769
it's not always easy actually really not

00:09:24.709 00:09:28.449
it takes it takes courage and discipline

00:09:28.839 00:09:32.079
and you have to want to do something for

00:09:32.209 00:09:34.449
yourself what I can tell you if you are

00:09:34.670 00:09:36.040
not doing anything for yourself

00:09:36.940 00:09:38.980
nobody's the only thing you get from

00:09:39.079 00:09:41.400
your doctors is the medicine and what is

00:09:42.410 00:09:44.139
you can see this does not work it

00:09:44.390 00:09:45.819
doesn't work in the long term it helps

00:09:46.040 00:09:47.680
just right now just solve the problem in

00:09:47.779 00:09:49.600
the situation just it for the next few

00:09:49.760 00:09:51.730
hours but it doesn't help you in the

00:09:51.920 00:09:54.220
long term it does not stop the dying the

00:09:55.220 00:09:57.550
process of your dying cells it does not

00:09:58.070 00:10:00.430
give you more dopamine or help your body

00:10:00.649 00:10:02.560
produce more dopamine or anything it

00:10:02.720 00:10:04.720
does not help you move better actually

00:10:05.480 00:10:07.480
if you get used to the medicine it gets

00:10:07.820 00:10:08.949
worse and you need more and more and

00:10:09.079 00:10:10.360
more and you will get to a limit quit

00:10:11.300 00:10:14.889
pretty soon for a person that is like

00:10:15.740 00:10:17.260
really old already

00:10:17.360 00:10:19.900
he had a good life before and just want

00:10:20.120 00:10:23.260
some some last few years to cover up

00:10:23.960 00:10:25.240
like this I think this is a whole

00:10:25.400 00:10:27.340
different story than for people like me

00:10:27.620 00:10:31.060
I am still young I am just starting my

00:10:31.100 00:10:35.040
life right now and I am looking for a

00:10:36.050 00:10:39.700
solution that strengthens my body that

00:10:40.550 00:10:44.710
keeps me healthy that helps me to learn

00:10:45.680 00:10:47.890
I want to learn how I can keep myself

00:10:48.290 00:10:51.700
healthy what my body needs different

00:10:51.980 00:10:55.210
than other people's bodies to keep

00:10:55.370 00:10:58.350
himself him to keep itself healthy and

00:10:59.360 00:11:00.700
after all of this research I know it is

00:11:00.920 00:11:03.400
possible I am right now working on

00:11:03.680 00:11:04.870
putting all this together in a book

00:11:05.120 00:11:08.260
because it's kind of complex to put the

00:11:08.480 00:11:09.850
pieces together even if I'm making

00:11:10.340 00:11:12.310
videos right now and it's kind of hard

00:11:12.410 00:11:15.520
if you don't have to hold picture um but

00:11:15.830 00:11:17.320
actually I just wanted to start off just

00:11:17.450 00:11:18.790
to let people know that I'm working on

00:11:19.010 00:11:21.310
it I will give you a pieces by pieces

00:11:21.860 00:11:22.960
sometimes this is a little bit better

00:11:23.560 00:11:26.020
and then getting all the information at

00:11:26.360 00:11:27.850
once it might be a little bit

00:11:28.240 00:11:31.480
overwhelming for some people but I will

00:11:32.030 00:11:34.000
just drop some drop a video in the

00:11:34.340 00:11:36.910
future here and there again if I read

00:11:37.520 00:11:40.690
something new and important and I think

00:11:40.820 00:11:42.970
is helpful for us to get the information

00:11:43.550 00:11:45.250
out there already because until the book

00:11:45.320 00:11:48.340
is out or the course I'm thinking about

00:11:48.590 00:11:50.050
making a video course because for a lot

00:11:50.210 00:11:52.870
of us if reading is not the best thing

00:11:53.570 00:11:55.240
because of the lack of concentration I

00:11:55.820 00:11:58.780
know I did and for that reason I am also

00:11:59.000 00:12:00.280
thinking about making a video course

00:12:00.680 00:12:04.030
where you can see me talking and and and

00:12:04.940 00:12:07.020
you just have to listen and not read

00:12:08.030 00:12:09.550
this would make it a little bit easier

00:12:09.830 00:12:11.530
and also I can show you the tricks on

00:12:12.040 00:12:14.710
video instead of explaining it this is

00:12:15.200 00:12:16.060
sometimes a little bit harder to

00:12:17.970 00:12:22.430
well anyways have I covered everything I

00:12:23.570 00:12:25.700
wanted since when you for a second I

00:12:25.860 00:12:28.070
guess this is good for now I will just

00:12:28.440 00:12:30.440
drop this video right now and you will

00:12:31.220 00:12:33.980
see you just best thing you could do it

00:12:34.200 00:12:36.920
is to click subscribe and click the bell

00:12:37.530 00:12:39.680

00:12:39.840 00:12:41.810

00:12:41.910 00:12:43.730

00:12:47.190 00:12:48.440

00:12:48.860 00:12:50.870
information as early as possible and

00:12:51.180 00:12:53.750
