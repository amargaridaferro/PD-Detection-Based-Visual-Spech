00:00:08.429 00:00:10.400
everyone it's Melissa today I am going

00:00:10.469 00:00:13.640
to talk about how I have dealt with hair

00:00:13.860 00:00:16.300
loss and the things I'm doing now and

00:00:17.310 00:00:20.060
things I've learned over the years with

00:00:20.460 00:00:22.070
different times in my life when my hair

00:00:22.320 00:00:24.950
has really thinned I wanted to add right

00:00:25.289 00:00:27.980
here in this introduction that if you

00:00:28.230 00:00:29.720
have a medical condition that is

00:00:30.060 00:00:30.950
suddenly making your hair fall out

00:00:31.349 00:00:32.990
please go to the doctor and find out

00:00:33.149 00:00:35.030
what it is it could be any number of

00:00:35.160 00:00:36.950
things that is causing this I'm just

00:00:37.170 00:00:39.560
kind of dealing with things that I had

00:00:40.140 00:00:41.510
experienced I knew the reason why my

00:00:41.730 00:00:42.740
hair was falling out

00:00:42.780 00:00:44.479
I knew the things I couldn't couldn't do

00:00:44.850 00:00:47.209
about it and so these this is the things

00:00:47.489 00:00:48.979
these are the steps that helped me deal

00:00:49.020 00:00:51.139
with hair shedding extra hair shedding

00:00:52.050 00:00:54.380
but if if it's a medical thing you need

00:00:54.420 00:00:56.330
to be seeing a doctor and yeah not

00:00:56.730 00:00:58.099
listening to somebody on YouTube so

00:00:58.559 00:00:59.900
please please take that into

00:00:59.940 00:01:01.610
consideration that it could be a medical

00:01:01.940 00:01:04.369
issue and so make sure you get cleared

00:01:04.530 00:01:05.960
by the doctor first to make sure there's

00:01:06.119 00:01:08.750
nothing more serious going on so back to

00:01:09.030 00:01:12.230
the regular video during different times

00:01:13.080 00:01:16.190
it really shed a whole lot the first

00:01:16.530 00:01:18.380
time I really noticed it was when in

00:01:19.290 00:01:22.190
2000 when my mother had to move down

00:01:22.740 00:01:24.170
close to us and part of the time live

00:01:24.299 00:01:27.140
with us when she had cancer and was

00:01:27.360 00:01:29.480
going through chemo and I took care of

00:01:29.700 00:01:31.670
her for three years before she passed

00:01:31.890 00:01:35.060
away and it was a very stressful time so

00:01:35.340 00:01:38.660
I noticed that my hair really started

00:01:38.700 00:01:41.840
I got a drain I got a strainer and put

00:01:41.970 00:01:44.929
in the bottom of the tub and so I could

00:01:45.180 00:01:46.730
see how much was coming out and a lot

00:01:46.950 00:01:48.440
was coming out I even got to her I would

00:01:48.899 00:01:51.200
count it it would be quite a bit more

00:01:51.479 00:01:52.670
than what was average because I would

00:01:52.799 00:01:54.230
look up what the average was you know

00:01:54.390 00:01:55.580
how much you're supposed to let used

00:01:56.280 00:01:57.830
everyday clothes everyday and mine was

00:01:58.020 00:02:00.679
more than that I started using then I

00:02:01.259 00:02:02.450
founded it salads I started doing all

00:02:02.549 00:02:04.490
the research reading and I found this

00:02:04.680 00:02:07.940
was in 2000 yo I found the nutria ox

00:02:08.459 00:02:11.540
system at Sally's the treatment

00:02:11.820 00:02:13.160
it was a three-part treatment these are

00:02:13.590 00:02:15.710
pretty much the same I remember the

00:02:16.590 00:02:19.400
treatment was more of a gel and you

00:02:19.920 00:02:20.960
squirted it out into your hand and put

00:02:21.060 00:02:23.060
it on your roots but now it's been

00:02:23.400 00:02:25.910
replaced by a spray it's kind of a you

00:02:26.010 00:02:28.430
know real watery spray but I used this

00:02:29.040 00:02:30.290
three-part system had really good luck

00:02:30.690 00:02:32.450
with it my mother had to go through

00:02:32.820 00:02:35.630
chemo the whole time and it really

00:02:35.970 00:02:37.940
helped with her hair loss too and you

00:02:38.040 00:02:38.930
know then I went on to different

00:02:39.630 00:02:41.510
shampoos started YouTube and went on

00:02:41.760 00:02:44.450
back and forth different shampoos and I

00:02:45.300 00:02:47.060
would go back periodically to new trucks

00:02:47.610 00:02:49.490
because you know I would notice it

00:02:49.650 00:02:51.440
within according to circumstances or

00:02:52.020 00:02:54.470
illness or things like that so I started

00:02:54.750 00:02:57.920
doing YouTube and you know I I went back

00:02:58.140 00:03:00.110
on it periodically and then regular

00:03:00.510 00:03:02.420
shampooed back on that and I don't

00:03:03.150 00:03:05.480
noticed that it didn't work quite as

00:03:05.700 00:03:08.180
well so I did some more research and I

00:03:08.700 00:03:11.990
went into the Noxon system that's what

00:03:12.120 00:03:13.580
I'm going to talk about today is in the

00:03:14.040 00:03:16.340
auxin I have tons and tons of people

00:03:16.620 00:03:17.720
that tell me they don't like they're not

00:03:18.209 00:03:20.000
oxen they like the that it does they

00:03:20.250 00:03:22.130
quit working for them so I said well try

00:03:22.200 00:03:23.750
the nude rocks and see if that works so

00:03:24.030 00:03:25.850
if one doesn't work try the other one

00:03:26.010 00:03:27.350
these are the only two I'm familiar with

00:03:27.570 00:03:29.570
so these the only two I can talk about I

00:03:29.850 00:03:32.090
know my friend al she really really

00:03:32.250 00:03:33.949
really likes the new trock system and

00:03:34.110 00:03:36.110
has worked very well for her and she

00:03:36.330 00:03:39.350
does derma rolling too which I will get

00:03:39.570 00:03:41.270
into that but it has been very

00:03:41.940 00:03:44.600
successful for her now talking about

00:03:45.060 00:03:46.850
derma rolling I don't do any derma

00:03:47.160 00:03:48.710
rolling on my skin or my scalp because

00:03:48.870 00:03:51.050
the medication that I am taking I am

00:03:51.330 00:03:53.180
prone to I'm going to be more prone to

00:03:53.820 00:03:55.250
infections that could be very serious so

00:03:55.440 00:03:57.500
I don't want to punch her my skin to

00:03:57.720 00:03:59.479
bring in the chance of extra bacterias a

00:04:00.360 00:04:01.850
multivitamin but taking extra things

00:04:02.070 00:04:05.030
like Barton or any extra vitamins have

00:04:05.340 00:04:06.470
have really seemed to kind of tear up my

00:04:06.989 00:04:10.310
system some so I don't do that I just do

00:04:10.769 00:04:12.490
try to take care of my hair physically

00:04:13.500 00:04:15.979
so that's that's what that's that that's

00:04:16.169 00:04:17.990
where I'm coming from is not taking

00:04:18.359 00:04:19.910
these extra things are not derma

00:04:20.280 00:04:21.410
these are the things I do but those are

00:04:21.780 00:04:23.030
certainly good options and that's what a

00:04:23.220 00:04:24.680
lot of people do it's really really

00:04:24.930 00:04:26.300
helped them a whole lot with hair loss

00:04:26.610 00:04:28.130
but it doesn't seem to be an option for

00:04:28.580 00:04:30.800
you these are the things that I do I

00:04:31.020 00:04:32.570
think we get to the age where we have to

00:04:32.730 00:04:34.220
have workarounds you know you get more

00:04:34.440 00:04:35.930
wrinkles so you have to do a workaround

00:04:36.650 00:04:39.710
with foundation or you get more wrinkles

00:04:40.140 00:04:41.570
you know your eyelids get crepey so you

00:04:41.730 00:04:43.430
have to do a workaround on that you know

00:04:43.470 00:04:45.320
I think the rest of our lives are

00:04:45.600 00:04:46.790
probably gonna be kind of work around

00:04:47.730 00:04:50.090
you know to look I feel our best working

00:04:50.430 00:04:52.010
around what we got to work with and what

00:04:52.320 00:04:55.940
to you know age tells us okay so I'm

00:04:56.070 00:04:57.350
gonna talk about the knocks and because

00:04:57.540 00:04:58.910
this is the one I'm using now and the

00:04:59.100 00:05:01.880
one that has been for the past year off

00:05:02.100 00:05:03.680
and on the one has that has worked the

00:05:03.870 00:05:05.690
best for me let me tell you which one I

00:05:06.030 00:05:09.800
use I use the number four it is four I

00:05:10.050 00:05:12.740
use the shampoo the shampoo the

00:05:13.230 00:05:15.830
conditioner and the treatment it's a

00:05:16.110 00:05:17.630
three part system you can buy them as a

00:05:17.940 00:05:19.490
kit but you can buy them separately I

00:05:19.710 00:05:21.200
buy them separately now because I use

00:05:21.420 00:05:23.060
them at different times use them up at

00:05:23.400 00:05:26.510
different times this is for I think

00:05:27.180 00:05:29.090
naksan has like a seven or eight systems

00:05:29.370 00:05:31.760
this one is for colored hair with

00:05:32.400 00:05:34.790
progressed thinning now the last time I

00:05:34.980 00:05:38.570
got sick I had very progressive thinning

00:05:38.730 00:05:42.530
I took pictures and I'm ashamed to say I

00:05:42.930 00:05:44.630
I just I can't bring myself to show them

00:05:44.760 00:05:46.940
on here it was pretty pretty bad hair

00:05:47.130 00:05:49.430
loss i disguised it well by keeping my

00:05:49.650 00:05:52.580
hair rolled and by using a powder you

00:05:52.980 00:05:54.770
know to cover it up with a brush and

00:05:55.590 00:05:57.290
keep it filled in but right through here

00:05:57.540 00:06:00.470
and on the top of my head on the crown I

00:06:00.870 00:06:03.200
had pretty bad hair loss where my scalp

00:06:03.390 00:06:07.850
was very much showing so you know I I

00:06:08.310 00:06:10.130
had to deal with that so what I have

00:06:10.490 00:06:13.190
done more recently is I have used that

00:06:13.380 00:06:15.050
an oxen and I feel like I was using it

00:06:15.210 00:06:17.330
correctly but I really I went to Ulta

00:06:17.850 00:06:19.490
and I read through all the questions

00:06:20.190 00:06:22.910
under the not auxin system and a

00:06:23.610 00:06:26.360
representative from Noxon was answering

00:06:26.460 00:06:27.920
a lot of questions so I went through

00:06:28.050 00:06:29.570
them all to see and they explained

00:06:29.820 00:06:31.350
exactly how this should be

00:06:32.039 00:06:34.920
used they said and it this is what has

00:06:35.110 00:06:37.619
been working for me it has worked for me

00:06:37.810 00:06:39.990
very well my hair loss is just so much

00:06:40.240 00:06:42.689
better now I use the strainer in the

00:06:42.879 00:06:44.429
best I lay my head over the bathtub and

00:06:44.500 00:06:47.070
I have a shower thing I handheld showers

00:06:47.229 00:06:50.550
that I wash my hair with and look to see

00:06:50.770 00:06:52.499
how much is in the strainer it is very

00:06:52.719 00:06:54.600
very little now and then when I get

00:06:55.150 00:06:56.640
tangles out I do that over the bathtub

00:06:57.189 00:06:59.309
too so I can see you when I clean up my

00:06:59.680 00:07:01.439
bathtub I can see in my hand how much

00:07:01.689 00:07:04.140
hair I've gotten out from also it's not

00:07:04.330 00:07:05.670
only from shampoo but from getting the

00:07:06.039 00:07:07.800
tangles out too so I'm keeping a pretty

00:07:07.990 00:07:09.390
good hold on how much hair I'm actually

00:07:09.879 00:07:11.969
losing so what they were saying on these

00:07:12.550 00:07:14.939
questions and answers is is what I've

00:07:15.099 00:07:17.580
been following and had good luck so the

00:07:17.919 00:07:20.010
number one thing they said give it give

00:07:20.169 00:07:23.159
it three months give it time and try to

00:07:23.650 00:07:25.469
shampoo your hair every day if you can

00:07:25.750 00:07:27.300
now I realize that you know you're like

00:07:27.520 00:07:29.279
me if you're like me I color my hair I

00:07:29.830 00:07:31.860
wear my hair long I do mine every other

00:07:32.139 00:07:33.689
day they say if you don't shampoo it

00:07:33.969 00:07:36.300
every day it is going to take a little

00:07:36.460 00:07:38.100
bit longer for your hair loss to be

00:07:38.529 00:07:41.040
reversed but to be patient it just takes

00:07:41.289 00:07:46.290
time to clean out those pores - you know

00:07:46.990 00:07:49.649
stimulate the follicles again and to you

00:07:49.690 00:07:51.570
know work on work on getting everything

00:07:51.909 00:07:54.029
cleaned out again so you shampoo your

00:07:54.250 00:07:56.790
hair and you know really get your scalp

00:07:57.039 00:07:59.909
clean I do it twice and whoops and I

00:08:00.250 00:08:03.119
used this shampoo then and I do exactly

00:08:03.370 00:08:05.399
as I say I do that twice that shampoo

00:08:05.680 00:08:07.260
twice then I put the conditioner on

00:08:07.629 00:08:09.600
first I'll put oh a good quarter size

00:08:10.060 00:08:11.309
anyway on the roots and run it through

00:08:12.310 00:08:13.920
then I put about half of that on my

00:08:14.500 00:08:16.709
scalp and then run it through my scalp

00:08:16.960 00:08:18.990
and I shampoo my scalp with it you know

00:08:19.360 00:08:20.339
and you know make sure you get so my

00:08:20.650 00:08:21.689
scalp covered real well especially

00:08:22.000 00:08:23.579
around the edges here and on the crown

00:08:23.889 00:08:26.070
cuz that's where I had most hair loss so

00:08:26.379 00:08:28.860
and then I set my watch and I do it for

00:08:29.199 00:08:32.610
three minutes and I just kind of stand

00:08:32.769 00:08:34.259
there sometimes I'll brush my teeth or

00:08:36.079 00:08:37.899
sometimes I'll clean out my bathtub but

00:08:38.269 00:08:39.489
I'll let it sit for three minutes and

00:08:39.800 00:08:41.619
after the three minutes is up I wash it

00:08:42.079 00:08:43.470
you know I'll rinse it out real well

00:08:44.480 00:08:46.989
okay then I do the step three which is

00:08:47.449 00:08:50.350
the treatment it is a mousse so shake it

00:08:50.509 00:08:52.900
up real well and I spray well I don't

00:08:53.089 00:08:54.100
spray it on my hand I spray it directly

00:08:54.470 00:08:56.110
in my hair hair mussed mousse is you

00:08:56.389 00:08:58.150
spray in your hand and it's not a big

00:08:58.790 00:09:00.069
buildup mousse it's kind of a watery

00:09:00.410 00:09:03.460
mousse so I spray right I spray three on

00:09:03.680 00:09:06.129
this side three on this side and three

00:09:06.259 00:09:08.650
on the crown and I really work it in

00:09:08.930 00:09:10.480
these areas really work it up here and

00:09:10.970 00:09:12.460
then I just take my fingers and do it

00:09:12.680 00:09:14.769
all over my scalp to stimulate that and

00:09:15.259 00:09:16.689
then I'll leave it for several minutes

00:09:16.999 00:09:18.699
before I get the tangles out before I

00:09:19.100 00:09:20.650
style my hair you can style your hair in

00:09:20.749 00:09:23.079
the normal way that you want to I try to

00:09:23.420 00:09:26.410
use as few products as I can so I just

00:09:26.809 00:09:29.980
use the mousse it's sort of a setting

00:09:30.199 00:09:31.269
thing I blow-dry my hair

00:09:31.569 00:09:34.869
and then I style it a lot of times I

00:09:34.939 00:09:36.639
will use like I did today use a big

00:09:37.129 00:09:38.799
curling iron and curl it and then put a

00:09:39.319 00:09:41.499
velcro roller in let it cool down take

00:09:41.660 00:09:44.350
it out fluff it up and then spray it

00:09:44.509 00:09:47.019
with just a little hairspray or I will

00:09:47.240 00:09:50.139
add a little extra mousse a curl curling

00:09:50.389 00:09:53.350
mousse but my favorite is the Garnier

00:09:53.839 00:09:56.519
curl construct and I will diffuse it and

00:09:57.529 00:10:00.100
wear it curly or I might blow dry it out

00:10:00.620 00:10:02.949
straight I will add a add something to

00:10:03.079 00:10:05.739
my ends to get it to to smooth down more

00:10:06.019 00:10:08.590
and I'll wear it straight so your base

00:10:09.170 00:10:10.869
you know you get your base done and then

00:10:10.999 00:10:12.249
you can fill with the rest of your hair

00:10:12.379 00:10:14.230
and style it the way you want to now

00:10:14.749 00:10:16.210
Washington so much with these two

00:10:16.759 00:10:18.759
shampoos with the nutria ox or with this

00:10:19.040 00:10:20.739
one it's going to dry your ends out so

00:10:21.410 00:10:23.110
you may have to add extra oils you may

00:10:23.269 00:10:24.910
have to do a leave-in conditioner you're

00:10:25.550 00:10:27.819
mainly with these systems you're mainly

00:10:28.279 00:10:31.119
taking care of you know this area right

00:10:31.429 00:10:33.610
through here all around through here and

00:10:34.100 00:10:35.710
the rest of it just treat it like your

00:10:35.870 00:10:37.419
other hair put extra conditioner in

00:10:37.939 00:10:39.549
extra anything that you need to get it

00:10:40.319 00:10:43.549
shape but - but I like to you know take

00:10:43.829 00:10:45.650
care of the road area of the scalp area

00:10:46.410 00:10:49.400
with these three products and I try not

00:10:49.589 00:10:51.769
to use any dry shampoo I try to shampoo

00:10:51.809 00:10:53.749
it frequently I try to keep it really

00:10:54.089 00:10:56.030
really clean the whole scalp area really

00:10:56.429 00:10:58.879
clean really without it getting clogged

00:10:59.339 00:11:01.489
I think we can use so much product

00:11:01.920 00:11:04.819
sometime or I did I used so much product

00:11:05.220 00:11:07.519
that I could tell that my my pores you

00:11:07.619 00:11:08.900
know my hair follicles were getting

00:11:09.569 00:11:13.850
clogged and they were dying so I've made

00:11:13.920 00:11:15.679
a point to really shampoo my hair very

00:11:16.350 00:11:18.650
often and to keep it very very clean and

00:11:19.139 00:11:20.809
keep those hair follicles stimulated I

00:11:21.029 00:11:22.850
think that's that's kind of what this

00:11:22.920 00:11:24.919
does is stimulate your hair follicles

00:11:25.769 00:11:27.710
now if you have other major issues that

00:11:27.839 00:11:29.179
you need to go to the doctor and they

00:11:29.399 00:11:30.710
need to do something else that's a whole

00:11:31.110 00:11:32.569
different story but if you're

00:11:33.329 00:11:34.910
experiencing some extra shedding and

00:11:35.160 00:11:36.710
some extra hair loss you know then this

00:11:36.989 00:11:39.470
might be something that is helpful for

00:11:39.809 00:11:42.379
you do this or the new trucks and you

00:11:42.449 00:11:43.489
know these are like I said these are the

00:11:43.769 00:11:45.559
ones that I've had experience with but

00:11:46.170 00:11:49.340
so anyway that is what I do to you know

00:11:49.679 00:11:51.530
help with hair loss with me I'm very

00:11:51.839 00:11:53.059
placed with it I'm placed with the

00:11:53.369 00:11:56.600
Nioxin system I've had good luck with it

00:11:56.910 00:11:58.879
and I'm kind of gonna start a thing I

00:11:59.459 00:12:01.939
think for hair stuff because I just like

00:12:02.100 00:12:03.530
to do different kinds of hair things

00:12:04.319 00:12:05.059
different hair stuff like to wear it

00:12:05.220 00:12:06.679
curly a lot towards straight oh I tore

00:12:06.720 00:12:08.869
it up down I like to tease up hair like

00:12:09.149 00:12:10.639
to smooth it down like to part it over

00:12:10.829 00:12:11.960
here a part of there anything you can

00:12:12.119 00:12:13.280
think of I like to do with my hair I'm

00:12:13.649 00:12:16.129
having fun with it afterward it's short

00:12:16.559 00:12:18.410
so long and so you know so many

00:12:19.139 00:12:20.299
different years of just wearing it the

00:12:20.490 00:12:22.189
same way so I'm having fun with it now

00:12:22.230 00:12:23.449
and I guess that's the main thing with

00:12:23.639 00:12:25.549
hair is just to have fun with it so I

00:12:25.769 00:12:28.819
will start a category a playlist this

00:12:29.160 00:12:32.389
one and then as I do more videos I might

00:12:32.610 00:12:34.999
do different ones them again what I'll

00:12:35.189 00:12:36.499
do is I'll go through and look at the

00:12:36.899 00:12:38.210
videos I've already done about hair and

00:12:38.459 00:12:39.710
either put them in there or if they

00:12:39.929 00:12:41.600
don't seem to apply anymore I will

00:12:41.970 00:12:44.210
remake it and delete the old one so I'm

00:12:44.519 00:12:46.039
kind of cleaning up my channel and

00:12:46.470 00:12:47.840
deleting videos that don't apply anymore

00:12:48.329 00:12:50.929
and then remaking them again just to

00:12:51.310 00:12:53.309
a little more relevant to to the age I

00:12:53.350 00:12:55.590
am now so thank you so much for watching

00:12:55.990 00:12:57.720

00:12:57.999 00:12:59.939
