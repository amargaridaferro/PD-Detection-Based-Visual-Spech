00:00:00.510 00:00:02.690
hi guys I thought I'd make a new video

00:00:03.240 00:00:06.320
so that way um I could update you on

00:00:06.899 00:00:12.110
things like my birthday and what's going

00:00:12.300 00:00:18.830
on with my exercise exercising and

00:00:19.020 00:00:30.290
eating and stuff like that last week was

00:00:30.330 00:00:35.000
my birthday on Friday so we could go and

00:00:35.969 00:00:39.520
that was kind of like one of my goals to

00:00:40.640 00:00:46.670
get healthier eat better exercise and I

00:00:47.670 00:00:50.779
wanted to lose I just like kind of put a

00:00:51.270 00:00:56.479
number like in my head 20 pounds if I

00:00:57.079 00:01:00.529
could so I ended up reaching that goal

00:01:01.550 00:01:05.119
and I lost 20 pounds by my birthday it

00:01:05.430 00:01:07.160
wasn't really hard to do it was I never

00:01:07.409 00:01:10.370
was like during the month of exercising

00:01:10.530 00:01:10.940
and eating right

00:01:11.040 00:01:14.630
I never starved myself because that that

00:01:15.000 00:01:16.820
doesn't work for me I will turn into a

00:01:17.100 00:01:19.130
mean monster and I wouldn't have any

00:01:19.850 00:01:24.969
energy so I was really excited about

00:01:25.979 00:01:27.910
being able to stick to eating good and

00:01:28.920 00:01:31.130
exercising a little bit every day and

00:01:31.950 00:01:33.319
losing the 20 pounds and it's been a

00:01:33.570 00:01:37.670
week since that and I've still lost some

00:01:37.829 00:01:43.460
more so I think I'm at I don't know 21

00:01:43.649 00:01:46.280
and a half pounds I've lost so far so

00:01:46.619 00:01:52.819
almost 22 so that is good and I don't

00:01:53.070 00:01:54.770
know if from the other video if I

00:01:55.350 00:01:57.920
explained what I'm eating to eat healthy

00:01:58.649 00:02:03.080
and what I'm not eating but I am just

00:02:03.540 00:02:06.230
sticking to eating a vegan diet so

00:02:06.840 00:02:09.559
nothing from an animal and also I'm not

00:02:10.110 00:02:11.990
eating flour or sugar

00:02:12.960 00:02:14.810
so I will eat sugar if it's like

00:02:15.810 00:02:20.270
naturally in a fruit but I won't you

00:02:20.370 00:02:21.920
know eat something that you have to put

00:02:22.170 00:02:26.780
sugar into it and I'm not eating flour

00:02:27.720 00:02:30.920
but I do eat things like in to replace

00:02:31.380 00:02:34.490
bread so I could still eat yummy food so

00:02:34.710 00:02:37.070
like I eat Ezekiel bread instead of

00:02:37.920 00:02:39.140
regular bread because it's a sprouted

00:02:39.420 00:02:45.830
green and it has more protein so I've

00:02:46.200 00:02:49.460
learned a lot of good yummy recipes that

00:02:49.560 00:02:52.640
are vegan I've made some really yucky

00:02:53.040 00:02:54.080
stuff that I've just had to throw away

00:02:54.959 00:02:56.810
and I've made some good stuff but um I

00:02:57.420 00:02:59.330
keep learning new things so that's kind

00:02:59.370 00:03:02.570
of exciting yesterday I didn't want to

00:03:03.030 00:03:04.370
exercise in the morning just because I

00:03:04.620 00:03:06.260
had been tired of just kind of bored of

00:03:06.990 00:03:07.790
exercising every morning right when I

00:03:08.010 00:03:12.260
wake up so instead I walked to the

00:03:12.900 00:03:15.800
99-cent store I'm not sure how far it is

00:03:16.019 00:03:18.320
for my house but it's maybe like I don't

00:03:18.510 00:03:20.810
know could be a mile probably maybe less

00:03:21.000 00:03:24.410
than a mile and I spent a couple hours

00:03:24.840 00:03:27.740
like looking through their stuff just

00:03:28.080 00:03:32.120
getting some different vegan items for

00:03:32.250 00:03:35.210
my pantry and some fresh fruits and

00:03:36.170 00:03:38.330
vegetables and I was actually surprised

00:03:38.790 00:03:42.979
at what I could find there like it was

00:03:43.500 00:03:46.100
surprising because 99-cent stores are a

00:03:46.260 00:03:47.539
little bit different than the other

00:03:47.820 00:03:50.240
dollar stores because they have produce

00:03:50.580 00:03:52.699
there so I actually got some good stuff

00:03:53.010 00:03:56.080
and I ate some good stuff last night but

00:03:57.090 00:03:58.789
what's funny is I brought a backpack

00:03:59.010 00:04:00.770
with me the kind that straps in the

00:04:01.040 00:04:07.759
front and two reusable bags and I just

00:04:08.040 00:04:09.890
bought whatever I wanted in the shopping

00:04:10.049 00:04:11.960
cart like whatever foods vegetables food

00:04:12.330 00:04:14.060
and something about healthier food

00:04:14.880 00:04:17.930
versus like processed food and junk food

00:04:18.209 00:04:19.430
is that you you don't really realize

00:04:19.859 00:04:25.120
this until you go all healthy food

00:04:26.130 00:04:27.559
natural food like fruits and vegetables

00:04:27.960 00:04:30.290
are really heavy because they have their

00:04:30.539 00:04:33.260
water inside of them and processed food

00:04:33.509 00:04:35.150
is like lighter like physically lighter

00:04:35.729 00:04:38.180
so what when I finished shopping and I

00:04:38.490 00:04:40.070
filled it's a really big backpack I

00:04:40.440 00:04:42.379
filled the backpack up I failed two

00:04:43.080 00:04:44.420
reusable shopping bags and then I had to

00:04:44.580 00:04:46.490
use to store bags because I didn't have

00:04:46.530 00:04:48.890
enough room and all that stuff so I had

00:04:49.740 00:04:51.260
backpack on strap

00:04:51.569 00:04:53.059
snapped in the front which helped it not

00:04:53.250 00:04:55.719
be too heavy on my shoulders and then

00:04:56.729 00:04:58.249
you know one reusable grocery bag in

00:04:58.380 00:04:58.790
this hand

00:04:59.400 00:05:00.620
totally full of fruits and vegetables

00:05:00.930 00:05:02.420
one in this hand and then one store bag

00:05:02.610 00:05:06.399
in this hand and one in this hand and

00:05:07.409 00:05:10.070
then I walked home and I made it but

00:05:10.259 00:05:11.540
when I got home I told my daughter I was

00:05:11.699 00:05:13.309
like get this scale out I want to stand

00:05:13.470 00:05:15.740
on the scale and then I'll just - my

00:05:16.050 00:05:17.659
weight from how much I weigh right now

00:05:18.000 00:05:20.749
with all this stuff on me and we looked

00:05:20.909 00:05:24.230
at it and it was fifty pounds so I was

00:05:24.630 00:05:27.830
carrying 50 pounds of fruits and

00:05:28.380 00:05:30.499
vegetables and it was just fun because I

00:05:30.690 00:05:33.129
got my workout in and my shopping done

00:05:34.139 00:05:40.990
all in one so that was fun um let's see

00:05:42.000 00:05:43.339
some other updates if you hear my voice

00:05:43.710 00:05:46.520
and it sounds really junky it's because

00:05:47.070 00:05:49.939
last week was a crazy week like I was

00:05:50.250 00:05:52.370
happy because it was my birthday but it

00:05:52.469 00:05:54.230
was a crazy week so my birthday was

00:05:54.509 00:05:57.670
Friday but let me just go back to Monday

00:05:58.680 00:06:01.550
like five days before my birthday it was

00:06:02.250 00:06:03.800
somewhat of a normal day I mean my

00:06:03.960 00:06:07.370
boyfriend we're running errands and come

00:06:07.650 00:06:10.760
home at night and put the kids to bed

00:06:10.919 00:06:13.520
and then I look on the I don't know I

00:06:13.800 00:06:16.040
was on Facebook or something and it says

00:06:16.469 00:06:17.779
that there's this little tiny you know a

00:06:18.060 00:06:20.659
little fire one town away I was like oh

00:06:21.210 00:06:22.520
and so I said something to my boyfriend

00:06:22.590 00:06:23.839
I was like there's a fire in the next

00:06:24.030 00:06:26.469
town over

00:06:28.430 00:06:31.189
then maybe 30 minutes later or like go

00:06:31.380 00:06:35.379
outside on my back patio and we see like

00:06:38.039 00:06:41.329
like flashing of flames and I was like

00:06:41.580 00:06:45.739
oh no no sorry I have to go back the

00:06:46.139 00:06:48.079
reason why we were okay so I saw on my

00:06:49.020 00:06:52.010
phone that there was a fire a little

00:06:52.259 00:06:54.230
fire in the town over no big deal

00:06:54.599 00:06:56.029
people have fires they're small it's

00:06:57.740 00:06:59.839
done why we went outside of my back

00:07:00.270 00:07:01.639
patio 30 minutes later was because the

00:07:01.889 00:07:03.499
power shut off here everything shut off

00:07:03.770 00:07:06.579
and that's not that weird here because

00:07:07.589 00:07:09.619
lately this last year we've had quite a

00:07:10.009 00:07:13.070
few at night they've been shutting the

00:07:13.289 00:07:14.959
power off for the whole night because

00:07:15.180 00:07:18.019
they're repairing something major and it

00:07:18.389 00:07:20.059
it only shuts the power off to half of

00:07:20.249 00:07:23.119
our condo condo complex which is really

00:07:23.279 00:07:25.129
big and so we have to figure out what

00:07:25.229 00:07:26.239
we're gonna do for the whole night with

00:07:26.309 00:07:28.249
the kids and we've gotten it down to

00:07:28.709 00:07:31.579
like we have lanterns and stuff like

00:07:31.830 00:07:34.040
that for each room ready to go and we

00:07:34.229 00:07:38.119
kind of have a system down to get

00:07:38.249 00:07:39.379
through the night without a bunch of

00:07:39.539 00:07:41.600
kids freaking out about using the

00:07:41.969 00:07:44.409
bathroom and total darkness and stuff

00:07:45.419 00:07:46.429
the other annoying thing about the power

00:07:46.620 00:07:48.799
going out is no fans work so you can't I

00:07:49.110 00:07:51.790
go to sleep at the fan noise so anyway

00:07:52.800 00:07:55.159
fire in the next town over no big deal

00:07:55.529 00:07:58.249
power goes off so we go outside and I

00:07:58.349 00:07:59.689
was like you know what that's where that

00:07:59.879 00:08:02.299
the power shut off because I didn't get

00:08:02.370 00:08:03.529
a notice that there were gonna shut the

00:08:03.719 00:08:07.040
power off and I was like do you think

00:08:07.289 00:08:08.749
that that fire in the next town over it

00:08:08.849 00:08:09.949
could be the reason why that there's

00:08:10.740 00:08:13.279
power shut off Andy and he was like I

00:08:13.319 00:08:15.139
don't know but then that's why we went

00:08:15.300 00:08:17.540
out on the back patio just to go outside

00:08:17.849 00:08:19.070
for a second because the power went off

00:08:19.199 00:08:20.059
I don't know how to look out the window

00:08:20.849 00:08:22.659
see if anybody else's power went off and

00:08:23.669 00:08:25.730
usually the condos next to us when they

00:08:25.889 00:08:27.320
should are power off they still have

00:08:28.189 00:08:30.469
power because only half of the complex

00:08:30.839 00:08:33.050
that's effected usually but when we went

00:08:33.180 00:08:35.719
outside we saw that all the power shop

00:08:35.969 00:08:39.199
not just our condos just everywhere and

00:08:39.360 00:08:40.399
that's when we looked up and saw

00:08:41.039 00:08:44.949
flickering flames and red in the sky

00:08:45.959 00:08:48.050
towards the mountains right here in

00:08:48.149 00:08:51.350
front of me or Hills and I was like

00:08:51.540 00:08:53.389
no way that can't be the fire that I

00:08:53.610 00:08:55.160
just read about 30 minutes ago on

00:08:55.709 00:08:57.769
Facebook in the next town over and sure

00:08:57.810 00:08:59.590
enough it was

00:09:00.600 00:09:02.900
we had Santa Ana winds and if you don't

00:09:03.209 00:09:04.880
know what Santa Ana winds are in

00:09:05.519 00:09:07.519
California kind of like in the fall I'm

00:09:07.680 00:09:08.990
gonna see I don't really know what what

00:09:09.240 00:09:09.920
season it is

00:09:10.800 00:09:12.380
and I I don't even know how to explain

00:09:12.450 00:09:13.759
it but I don't know if it's like cold

00:09:13.950 00:09:15.980
air meets warm air whatever but what it

00:09:16.140 00:09:20.329
is it's a really dry crazy wind that we

00:09:20.579 00:09:24.880
get but it's it's really hot usually too

00:09:25.890 00:09:28.160
so we're having Santa Ana winds and then

00:09:28.350 00:09:33.829
there's this fire so that made a crazy

00:09:34.649 00:09:37.720
hot mess god yeah I get emotional again

00:09:38.730 00:09:42.170
but last week was crazy so I don't care

00:09:42.240 00:09:46.340
if I get emotional so the power went off

00:09:46.740 00:09:48.110
without us knowing it's going to go off

00:09:48.390 00:09:51.110
so none of our stuff was charged you

00:09:51.240 00:09:52.940
know none of our batteries extra things

00:09:53.130 00:09:54.949
that you do before you know powers gonna

00:09:55.110 00:09:58.460
get shut off was charged so I put the

00:09:58.680 00:10:02.000
kids to bed but I was worried because I

00:10:02.250 00:10:05.769
didn't know oh I hate when I cry I

00:10:06.779 00:10:09.139
didn't know if we were gonna have to

00:10:09.269 00:10:11.990
leave the house soon or not because even

00:10:12.089 00:10:13.280
though I don't normally worry about

00:10:13.529 00:10:15.500
fires when they're like a city away this

00:10:15.779 00:10:19.329
fire was moving so fast I didn't know

00:10:20.339 00:10:21.199
where it was gonna go

00:10:21.510 00:10:23.210
I've lived in worse places in my town

00:10:23.250 00:10:25.069
that are closest closer to the hills

00:10:25.440 00:10:27.650
that burn right now I actually live the

00:10:28.050 00:10:29.990
furthest from the hills that I've ever

00:10:30.540 00:10:32.210
lived but it didn't really matter at

00:10:32.250 00:10:34.220
that point because it was coming closer

00:10:34.350 00:10:35.600
and closer and closer and they were

00:10:35.790 00:10:38.240
having to evacuate people so quickly and

00:10:38.519 00:10:41.269
so many people that you didn't really

00:10:41.519 00:10:43.189
know if you should go or if you should

00:10:43.970 00:10:47.569
stay and if it was just I don't know

00:10:47.820 00:10:50.090
it's just having a lot of kids all

00:10:51.000 00:10:53.240
suddenly leaving really quick it's it

00:10:53.339 00:11:00.050
would be crazy and anyway I had to go to

00:11:01.110 00:11:02.780
put the kids to sleep but not knowing

00:11:03.329 00:11:05.060
like if we need to leave

00:11:05.370 00:11:07.880
night or not and since the power went

00:11:07.950 00:11:11.330
off and I couldn't my my phone wasn't

00:11:11.790 00:11:15.440
charged I lost power to my phone in the

00:11:15.630 00:11:16.190
middle of the night and there was

00:11:16.470 00:11:20.720
nothing I could do so I got through the

00:11:20.910 00:11:23.060
night but then it like I don't know four

00:11:23.100 00:11:24.440
or five in the morning I couldn't take

00:11:24.480 00:11:28.400
it anymore not knowing so um I got up

00:11:28.530 00:11:29.600
and went out to my garage because I

00:11:29.970 00:11:31.610
remembered we have this one of those

00:11:31.980 00:11:35.150
solar power things that put in the Sun

00:11:35.340 00:11:36.380
at chargers and then you can plug your

00:11:36.540 00:11:38.990
phone into it and it had already been

00:11:39.420 00:11:40.520
charged so I plugged it into my phone

00:11:40.770 00:11:42.550
got some more power and I was like okay

00:11:43.560 00:11:45.140
we still don't need to leave yet because

00:11:45.270 00:11:48.830
it hasn't hit near the street for us to

00:11:49.800 00:11:51.560
evacuate I just kept saying like there's

00:11:51.720 00:11:54.890
like a freeway in between me and and the

00:11:55.140 00:11:57.560
fire and that doesn't necessarily matter

00:11:57.930 00:12:01.790
because it jumped freeways this fire for

00:12:02.160 00:12:05.420
anybody who seen the news the fire's

00:12:05.730 00:12:10.490
name was the Thomas fire so or is the

00:12:10.770 00:12:11.980
Thomas fire because it's still burning

00:12:12.990 00:12:14.510
and yesterday it killed a firefighter

00:12:14.790 00:12:16.640
which is really sad because we had

00:12:16.890 00:12:19.190
gotten away with nobody dying yet except

00:12:19.230 00:12:22.220
for um when the first when the fire

00:12:22.440 00:12:25.670
first started last week somebody in the

00:12:25.920 00:12:28.670
city where the fire started was fleeing

00:12:29.220 00:12:31.070
from the fire and they died in a car

00:12:33.980 00:12:38.320
accident but yeah so my phone died

00:12:39.330 00:12:40.520
charged it so I could find out where it

00:12:40.940 00:12:43.190
was the evacuations never ended up

00:12:43.470 00:12:46.370
making it is close enough to my street

00:12:47.190 00:12:50.360
it was like one major street over so I

00:12:50.700 00:12:54.070
told myself it got to the street where

00:12:55.080 00:12:59.030
we live that will leave so I'm really

00:12:59.250 00:13:00.680
thankful that we didn't have to leave

00:13:01.020 00:13:02.840
and that it didn't threaten our house

00:13:03.690 00:13:05.960
none of my family members lost their

00:13:06.380 00:13:10.360
homes but they did have to leave where

00:13:11.370 00:13:16.130
they were my mom's in my aunt's home the

00:13:16.380 00:13:18.380
fire I think I haven't seen it but

00:13:18.510 00:13:20.420
I think from what they've described the

00:13:20.640 00:13:23.060
fire just burned all their neighbors

00:13:23.490 00:13:25.700
homes and jumped over their house it

00:13:25.950 00:13:28.850
burned some like vegetation on their

00:13:29.250 00:13:30.590
property but it didn't burn their home

00:13:30.780 00:13:32.690
it just jumped over so that I was really

00:13:36.560 00:13:39.580
really here I get going again

00:13:40.590 00:13:44.360
thankful that that didn't burn I know

00:13:44.700 00:13:46.490
that stuff and houses don't matter but

00:13:46.770 00:13:47.750
still you don't want to think about your

00:13:48.410 00:13:50.450
parents not having their home or not

00:13:50.670 00:13:53.060
being in a home so they had to stay this

00:13:53.280 00:13:57.410
week in my town because this fire has

00:13:57.660 00:14:01.730
burned several towns so they had to stay

00:14:01.770 00:14:04.370
in my town but on the other side of town

00:14:04.740 00:14:07.130
where it's you know worse hit by the

00:14:07.410 00:14:10.430
fire and smoke II just see how much time

00:14:10.500 00:14:15.920
I have to talk um so it's just been

00:14:16.410 00:14:20.630
crazy because since this is going on

00:14:21.480 00:14:28.030
let's see one two weeks of no school no

00:14:29.040 00:14:30.920
active extracurricular activities no

00:14:31.320 00:14:33.070
church activities like everything's

00:14:35.270 00:14:38.780
canceled it's two weeks of smokey really

00:14:38.970 00:14:42.590
bad air quality so I've had all the kids

00:14:43.050 00:14:45.350
inside for two weeks we've never done

00:14:45.420 00:14:49.400
that before like it's crazy like we stay

00:14:49.650 00:14:52.070
home most of us my boyfriend's kid goes

00:14:52.110 00:14:55.970
to school public school but my kids are

00:14:56.190 00:14:57.620
home-schooled and so we're used to being

00:14:57.840 00:14:59.090
home in homeschooled but that doesn't

00:14:59.160 00:15:01.370
mean we stay home and and stay inside

00:15:01.770 00:15:04.040
all the time the kids go to the parks

00:15:04.290 00:15:06.200
they go to church several times a week

00:15:06.480 00:15:08.240
they go to other activities that they've

00:15:08.460 00:15:10.940
signed up throughout the week so it's a

00:15:11.550 00:15:13.160
then we've been making the most of it

00:15:13.350 00:15:15.230
like playing games and doing Christmas

00:15:16.020 00:15:19.000
activities and projects but it's really

00:15:20.010 00:15:21.290
like the last couple days I really was

00:15:21.420 00:15:22.430
like oh my gosh

00:15:22.470 00:15:25.520
I cannot take this like being stuck

00:15:25.710 00:15:27.850
inside for

00:15:28.250 00:15:29.949
two weeks with kids that can't run

00:15:30.110 00:15:31.540
around and jump and play because my

00:15:31.880 00:15:34.060
place isn't big enough for them to you

00:15:34.100 00:15:39.850
know run around so but I really have

00:15:40.100 00:15:42.069
nothing to be complaining about because

00:15:42.470 00:15:44.259
we didn't get hurt or lose anything and

00:15:44.480 00:15:47.740
so many people in my town did I lose

00:15:48.200 00:15:51.220
everything like just it's sad because

00:15:52.269 00:15:55.420
it's right before Christmas and people

00:15:55.730 00:15:59.610
did you know lost homes lost their stuff

00:16:00.620 00:16:03.190
their Christmas stuff and then also time

00:16:03.589 00:16:06.130
lost for work because things have been

00:16:07.570 00:16:09.610
closed because of the air quality

00:16:09.980 00:16:11.050
depending on which part of town you are

00:16:12.610 00:16:19.050
and it's just really crazy but anyway

00:16:20.060 00:16:22.150
hopefully soon the air will clear up

00:16:22.730 00:16:24.610
outside it just feels like you're

00:16:25.040 00:16:27.639
constantly breathing in tons of

00:16:28.579 00:16:29.170
cigarette smoke

00:16:29.480 00:16:36.519
all the time it's really gross but um so

00:16:37.130 00:16:38.650
those were the crazy things the bad

00:16:38.959 00:16:41.530
things like last week but still my

00:16:41.600 00:16:44.740
birthday came on Friday and even though

00:16:45.019 00:16:49.210
we were smokey stuck inside I was still

00:16:49.370 00:16:52.540
happy because I had ate right all month

00:16:52.699 00:16:55.180
and exercised and reached my goal that I

00:16:55.519 00:17:02.759
wanted to so I was feeling really good

00:17:03.769 00:17:05.770
and my boyfriend came home from work and

00:17:06.140 00:17:10.840
he gave me find it I thought my glasses

00:17:11.030 00:17:13.419
on so I can't see he gave me a teddy

00:17:13.520 00:17:16.059
bear and I named him Smokey the Bear and

00:17:16.699 00:17:19.659
he gave me this really beautiful bouquet

00:17:19.699 00:17:22.390
of flowers it was like part Christmasy

00:17:22.760 00:17:24.130
part summary I don't know it had like

00:17:24.740 00:17:27.449
sunflowers and roses and pine branches

00:17:28.459 00:17:29.860
in it and it was really beautiful and I

00:17:29.960 00:17:33.310
was so excited and the kids made me a

00:17:33.530 00:17:34.840
bunch of really awesome birthday cards

00:17:35.450 00:17:36.700
which I should show you sometime because

00:17:36.830 00:17:38.530
they're really awesome like the art they

00:17:38.720 00:17:40.960
did one daughter made me like

00:17:41.600 00:17:43.419
it was Doug funnie and she drew him so

00:17:43.640 00:17:45.549
good on the card another daughter made

00:17:45.770 00:17:48.820

00:17:48.950 00:17:50.080

00:17:53.600 00:17:55.510
and my other daughter made me a card

00:17:55.820 00:17:58.899
that was like a Google said like Google

00:17:59.720 00:18:01.600
they had like the Google logo and it had

00:18:01.880 00:18:04.029
something typed in like written drawn in

00:18:04.880 00:18:06.340
for the search button and they were all

00:18:06.500 00:18:12.880
really cute then but the kind of like

00:18:13.309 00:18:15.010
bummer ish thing that I found out on my

00:18:15.230 00:18:16.750
birthday I was happy about the roses and

00:18:16.850 00:18:21.580
the flowers is that my boyfriend usually

00:18:21.740 00:18:23.919
works during the daytime but because of

00:18:24.230 00:18:27.060
the fire the fire was where his work is

00:18:28.270 00:18:31.480
he had to go work a night shift which he

00:18:31.669 00:18:33.640
never works at night because of the fire

00:18:34.070 00:18:35.320
somebody had to be there to open the

00:18:35.539 00:18:36.850
gates and shut the gates and open the

00:18:37.010 00:18:38.440
gates every time the fire trucks needed

00:18:38.600 00:18:42.840
to go onto the property or the police

00:18:43.850 00:18:44.919
because there was fires up there didn't

00:18:45.080 00:18:46.390
burn any of the buildings there but it

00:18:46.580 00:18:47.830
burned the vegetation and they had to

00:18:48.049 00:18:51.010
keep it from burning the buildings so I

00:18:51.470 00:18:52.779
found out that he had to work on my

00:18:53.240 00:18:55.630
birthday so like basically at night time

00:18:56.000 00:18:57.340
after dinner he had to go to work and

00:18:57.530 00:18:59.260
work the whole night so I was a little

00:18:59.390 00:19:01.480
bit sad because you know you want to

00:19:01.730 00:19:04.060
spend your birthday with the person that

00:19:04.280 00:19:11.289
you love so but then he said oh you were

00:19:11.720 00:19:13.000
having I gave the kids ice cream because

00:19:13.070 00:19:14.289
I wanted them to be able to celebrate my

00:19:14.600 00:19:15.490
birthday but I didn't want to eat ice

00:19:15.530 00:19:17.080
cream because I'm trying not to eat that

00:19:17.809 00:19:19.600
kind of food so I got the mice cream and

00:19:19.669 00:19:21.549
I gave them ice cream and he was like

00:19:23.169 00:19:25.090
okay well let me go get something or

00:19:25.460 00:19:26.409
something and he went down the hall and

00:19:26.510 00:19:32.620
he came back and um all the kids were

00:19:32.840 00:19:37.060
sitting there at the table eating their

00:19:37.100 00:19:40.600
ice cream and he got down oh I hate it

00:19:40.789 00:19:42.760
when I cry he got down on one knee and

00:19:42.830 00:19:44.950
he gave me this and I don't know if you

00:19:45.080 00:19:46.419
can see it dude and you probably won't

00:19:46.610 00:19:48.180
be able to because my camera won't focus

00:19:49.190 00:19:52.690
but it's a sparkly super sparkly diamond

00:19:53.179 00:19:54.130
heart ring

00:19:54.230 00:19:56.620
and I have to show you a photo sometime

00:19:56.840 00:19:59.169
because my camera is not gonna focus but

00:19:59.360 00:20:02.950
it was just really cool because maybe

00:20:03.260 00:20:05.020
most people would want to be like you

00:20:05.120 00:20:06.820
know somewhere romantic getting proposed

00:20:07.070 00:20:14.770
to but him proposing to me in front of

00:20:14.960 00:20:17.890
all of our kids almost all of our kids

00:20:18.740 00:20:23.169
one wasn't there but meant more to me

00:20:23.240 00:20:24.610
than taking me somewhere else because

00:20:25.040 00:20:28.090
you know it's not just him and me it's

00:20:28.640 00:20:31.510
the kids oh hey when I cry you're gonna

00:20:31.850 00:20:34.090
stop so I can save this video and not

00:20:34.429 00:20:38.169
delete it I was just really awesome so

00:20:39.020 00:20:42.940
that was like the happy moment of my

00:20:43.309 00:20:44.590
birthday and I'm still excited about it

00:20:44.690 00:20:46.870
because I totally didn't expect that I

00:20:47.419 00:20:49.390
was happy with the flowers in this the

00:20:51.309 00:20:55.630
so anyway stop crying maybe if I put my

00:20:55.760 00:21:01.510
glasses on I'll stop crying okay so it

00:21:01.669 00:21:03.760
was a crazy long video with lots of

00:21:04.250 00:21:09.250
emotions but um hopefully this guys will

00:21:09.620 00:21:13.000
clear up they cancelled public school

00:21:13.250 00:21:15.730
for the rest of the month so that's been

00:21:15.980 00:21:18.370
hard because I am used to some kids

00:21:18.559 00:21:20.350
being home and some at school and it

00:21:20.750 00:21:24.460
helps me just get more things done I

00:21:24.770 00:21:26.409
don't know we just have a routine or a

00:21:26.809 00:21:29.770
way that we do things but um it'll work

00:21:29.990 00:21:35.409
out and I'm certainly glad I've been

00:21:36.130 00:21:39.240
eating healthy and exercising because I

00:21:40.250 00:21:41.080
don't think I would have made it through

00:21:41.450 00:21:43.720
this last week super stressful if I

00:21:43.910 00:21:45.789
didn't have something that helps me

00:21:46.490 00:21:48.700
de-stress like exercising and eating

00:21:49.960 00:21:52.630
right even eating like the vegan no

00:21:52.940 00:21:57.280
flour no sugar lay it's helped me

00:21:57.620 00:21:59.500
because it stabilizes my mood and it

00:21:59.809 00:22:00.159
helps me uh

00:22:01.270 00:22:04.000
I don't get like crazy hungry all of a

00:22:04.309 00:22:06.820
sudden within like 30 minutes after

00:22:07.370 00:22:08.950
I don't want to eat again I actually

00:22:09.259 00:22:11.139
won't eat for a while now because I just

00:22:11.539 00:22:14.200
feel really full where before when I

00:22:14.419 00:22:16.239
just ate whatever junk food or whatever

00:22:16.490 00:22:20.529
I wanted um just seems like 30 minutes

00:22:20.720 00:22:27.960
later I was always hungry again so yes I

00:22:28.970 00:22:31.960
think that's all I wanted to say that

00:22:32.090 00:22:39.190
was a lot but yeah so Oh another thing

00:22:39.499 00:22:41.710
is let's see last month mostly for

00:22:42.139 00:22:43.629
exercise I did this one like total body

00:22:44.179 00:22:46.930
workout fifteen minute workout but I

00:22:47.119 00:22:48.730
kind of got bored of that so I went back

00:22:49.070 00:22:52.359
I went and started doing belly dancing

00:22:52.820 00:22:55.930
workout videos because I used to do that

00:22:56.059 00:22:59.230
in the past like the videos and so

00:22:59.419 00:23:00.909
that's something I'm familiar with and

00:23:01.429 00:23:03.730
it's a really good workout but it's also

00:23:04.009 00:23:05.499
really nice because it's low-impact so

00:23:05.570 00:23:08.310
you don't like damage your joints and

00:23:09.320 00:23:11.560
it's fun too so if I get bored of an

00:23:12.049 00:23:13.899
exercise then I don't want to do it

00:23:14.080 00:23:16.539
anymore but the belly dancing is fun and

00:23:17.029 00:23:19.239
sometimes my girls like to do the

00:23:19.700 00:23:21.100
exercise with me so that's fun too

00:23:21.590 00:23:23.289
because and I'm getting them to exercise

00:23:23.659 00:23:29.519
and we're doing something together so I

00:23:30.529 00:23:36.909
think that's it maybe next time I'll

00:23:37.159 00:23:38.379
share some of the foods that I like to

00:23:38.450 00:23:41.169
eat on my vegan diet

00:23:41.779 00:23:43.210
I'm not deprived in any way I actually

00:23:43.639 00:23:45.430
feel like I eat more variety of

00:23:45.860 00:23:47.529
different foods and like my food a lot

00:23:47.779 00:23:49.659
more now and I get more excited about

00:23:51.249 00:23:58.299
eating that I used to and I think that's

00:23:58.580 00:24:02.200
it I think the last week or two we've

00:24:02.659 00:24:04.930
survived being stuck inside by playing a

00:24:05.899 00:24:07.810
lot of rounds of apples to apples I

00:24:08.330 00:24:09.249
don't know if any of you guys know what

00:24:09.470 00:24:12.340
that game is but it's fun because you

00:24:12.499 00:24:14.320
know almost all my kids can play the

00:24:14.539 00:24:16.869
game only my youngest who is going to

00:24:17.210 00:24:19.480
turn 4 she's 3 right now she's going to

00:24:19.610 00:24:20.980
turn four next week she's

00:24:21.050 00:24:22.930
the only one that can't play it because

00:24:23.330 00:24:25.360
she can she can probably read like one

00:24:26.000 00:24:28.240
word or two word but she can't read they

00:24:29.210 00:24:31.330
we have like the regular regular normal

00:24:31.700 00:24:33.460
adult version of apples-to-apples she

00:24:33.650 00:24:34.690
can't read the words so she just plays

00:24:34.730 00:24:36.520
with the cards and gets really grumpy

00:24:36.980 00:24:38.740
that she can't play with us but all the

00:24:38.900 00:24:40.750
rest of us can play and we have a lot of

00:24:41.090 00:24:45.340
fun I never win my kids win but mostly

00:24:45.530 00:24:47.530
one daughter she's just I don't know she

00:24:47.750 00:24:49.410
wins every time

00:24:51.670 00:24:54.549
I I don't know if this work but I'm

00:24:54.679 00:24:57.970
gonna try to edit this video in with my

00:24:58.130 00:24:59.530
other video because I just remembered

00:24:59.600 00:25:02.380
something I wanted to add something

00:25:02.720 00:25:04.270
about my Parkinson's medication and

00:25:05.240 00:25:06.940
something that I keep doing that drives

00:25:07.130 00:25:09.220
me nuts I'm supposed to take my medicine

00:25:09.650 00:25:12.220
for breakfast lunch and dinner and then

00:25:12.260 00:25:15.490
a different one of the same medicine but

00:25:15.650 00:25:18.160
it's at night when I go to bed but it's

00:25:18.320 00:25:21.280
an extended release that way I can get

00:25:21.380 00:25:22.510
the medicine all night while I'm

00:25:23.020 00:25:27.190
sleeping um so I take care a'dope

00:25:27.679 00:25:31.320
levodopa if I even pronounced that right

00:25:32.330 00:25:35.700
to deal with my tremors and my stiffness

00:25:36.710 00:25:38.830
I'm I take one breakfast lunch dinner

00:25:39.290 00:25:40.900
and then like I said right before I go

00:25:40.940 00:25:47.830
to bed but I'm constantly going to sit

00:25:47.870 00:25:49.419
down for breakfast or lunch or dinner

00:25:50.270 00:25:52.870
setting my pill bottle down and then not

00:25:53.300 00:25:54.430
being able to remember if I actually

00:25:54.830 00:25:58.600
took it so then I'm like did I take my

00:25:58.790 00:26:00.040
pill and then sometimes I can think oh

00:26:00.230 00:26:01.690
yeah I did I remember swallowing it and

00:26:02.390 00:26:04.060
then other times I completely can't

00:26:04.370 00:26:05.560
remember so most of the time I remember

00:26:05.960 00:26:07.440
and I take it and I'm fine

00:26:08.450 00:26:12.419
but last week sat down it's really busy

00:26:13.429 00:26:14.890
crazy week you know I just told the

00:26:14.929 00:26:17.350
whole story about last week um for

00:26:18.620 00:26:21.790
set my pill bottle down went to eat my

00:26:21.980 00:26:24.760
dinner with my boyfriend I couldn't

00:26:24.890 00:26:27.610
remember if I took it or not and we got

00:26:27.710 00:26:29.560
up from the table went to watch a movie

00:26:29.660 00:26:31.330
or something and I still couldn't

00:26:31.610 00:26:33.700
remember if I took it or not and then I

00:26:34.100 00:26:34.720
started to really have

00:26:34.940 00:26:36.580
doubts about like an hour later I didn't

00:26:36.830 00:26:39.400
take my medicine and I was like shaking

00:26:39.710 00:26:42.400
really bad but I was like I can't

00:26:42.620 00:26:44.260
remember I don't want to take it I'll

00:26:44.330 00:26:46.330
just wait take my bedtime pill cuz maybe

00:26:46.490 00:26:49.690
I did take it but I went to get up from

00:26:50.210 00:26:51.880
the movie to like go to the bathroom or

00:26:52.010 00:26:54.400
go down the hall and that's when I was

00:26:54.470 00:26:57.370
like I didn't take my pill so what I

00:26:57.650 00:26:59.680
don't take sometimes I'm like do I need

00:27:00.350 00:27:01.780
medicine why am i taking medicine maybe

00:27:01.880 00:27:03.490
I shouldn't take medicine people say

00:27:03.830 00:27:06.669
don't take medicine but for anybody that

00:27:06.890 00:27:11.350
says that for me that's just [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:27:11.840 00:27:13.780
like I am NOT gonna not take the

00:27:14.179 00:27:16.390
medicine because this whole last year

00:27:16.640 00:27:19.780
when I didn't have the medicine I wasn't

00:27:20.630 00:27:21.880
moving around very much because I

00:27:23.140 00:27:26.590
couldn't so I am gonna take my medicine

00:27:26.780 00:27:28.810
and I'd like taking my medicine because

00:27:29.270 00:27:30.940
I'd like to move around and do things

00:27:31.250 00:27:33.190
with my children and my family cleaning

00:27:33.650 00:27:35.440
and taking care of myself and taking

00:27:35.570 00:27:39.700
care of them so when I went to go down

00:27:39.890 00:27:41.590
the hall I when I don't take my medicine

00:27:42.110 00:27:45.340
I can't move the left half of my body my

00:27:46.040 00:27:50.560
left leg just drags I Britt I can't like

00:27:50.990 00:27:55.120
tell my foot to like pick up so I just

00:27:55.720 00:28:02.130
drag the left leg and then my left arm

00:28:03.140 00:28:05.730
instead of swinging it just gets stuck

00:28:06.740 00:28:09.039
down by my side so my arm is stuck

00:28:09.500 00:28:13.150
straight down but then my fingers I have

00:28:13.190 00:28:15.220
a really weird tremor it's not like the

00:28:15.410 00:28:18.580
regular Parkinson's tremor instead my

00:28:18.919 00:28:20.919
fingers go side to side like I can't

00:28:21.080 00:28:22.360
show you a tremor right now because I'm

00:28:22.580 00:28:24.640
on my meds but my fingers go crazy like

00:28:24.980 00:28:27.520
the side to side so my arm will be glued

00:28:27.679 00:28:29.560
to my side my fingers will be going like

00:28:29.720 00:28:31.900
crazy and my left legs dragging and

00:28:32.840 00:28:34.180
that's how I have to try to move and

00:28:34.340 00:28:37.510
it's just and it's really slow like I if

00:28:37.700 00:28:39.820
I want to go down the hall it's just

00:28:39.980 00:28:42.430
gonna take some time I'm gonna have like

00:28:42.590 00:28:44.140
I can't have any road blocks like if my

00:28:44.360 00:28:45.250
kids are going down the hall I'm like

00:28:45.590 00:28:47.230
okay I'll just go this side you go

00:28:47.330 00:28:48.669
around me and then I'll wait for you to

00:28:50.600 00:28:52.600
so sometimes I'll lean against on my

00:28:52.820 00:28:53.920
right side I'll lean against the wall

00:28:54.230 00:28:56.050
and I'll slide down the wall

00:28:56.420 00:28:58.210
that's the hall or sometimes I'll just

00:28:59.150 00:28:59.710
go slow

00:28:59.980 00:29:01.900
but that's all I just wanted to add that

00:29:02.090 00:29:06.760
in there for anybody else it has to take

00:29:07.370 00:29:08.950
medication or anybody that's curious

00:29:09.190 00:29:11.980
about Parkinson's or anybody that's

00:29:12.260 00:29:13.150
trying to tell me not to take the

00:29:13.700 00:29:17.230
medicine because I exercise already I

00:29:17.930 00:29:22.510
eat healthy and I still have problems so

00:29:23.480 00:29:27.100
I'm happier exercising eating right so I

00:29:27.590 00:29:29.650
definitely agree exercising and eating

00:29:29.840 00:29:33.880
right is the way to go for Parkinson's

00:29:34.040 00:29:36.010
and probably for any disease or problem

00:29:36.430 00:29:39.010
or even if you don't have problems it's

00:29:39.200 00:29:41.050
good for you and it has made a

00:29:41.510 00:29:43.780
difference for me but it hasn't like

00:29:44.510 00:29:47.350
cured me or fixed me so yeah I still

00:29:47.570 00:29:49.630
take my medication because I like to

00:29:51.730 00:29:55.330
walk okay bye
