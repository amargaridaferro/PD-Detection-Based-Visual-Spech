00:00:04.830 00:00:26.450
hi y'all thoughts about retirement

00:00:27.460 00:00:29.970
retirement and trying to build your own

00:00:30.340 00:00:31.500
home there were lots of the work

00:00:32.079 00:00:35.460
yourself but also moving to another new

00:00:35.830 00:00:37.860
area in which you don't know a lots of

00:00:37.989 00:00:42.030
the contractors those are a little bit

00:00:42.160 00:00:46.200
of the obstacles that we faced and some

00:00:46.330 00:00:48.479
of our expectations on where we would be

00:00:48.820 00:00:51.689
or maybe more my expectations at this

00:00:52.210 00:00:57.450
point in the process were different when

00:00:57.940 00:00:59.549
you are doing a lots of the work

00:00:59.799 00:01:01.829
yourself and you're using what equipment

00:01:02.140 00:01:05.399
you have that's slow when you're trying

00:01:05.710 00:01:08.609
to track down contractors what I've

00:01:08.979 00:01:12.330
found in this area is that people that

00:01:12.490 00:01:14.430
are already building homes for a living

00:01:14.590 00:01:17.630
are kind of protective of their their

00:01:18.640 00:01:19.740
subcontractors that they work with so

00:01:20.080 00:01:22.550
trying to find a good contractor

00:01:23.560 00:01:24.990
frequently we're told this is a good one

00:01:25.210 00:01:27.270
because kind of high or this is good

00:01:27.460 00:01:30.469
when he's kind of high and he's busy so

00:01:31.479 00:01:34.349
we're at the point that we're ready for

00:01:34.659 00:01:35.789
someone to come out and start building

00:01:36.700 00:01:40.440
the foundation so that and get those

00:01:40.810 00:01:42.359
bids from the electrician and it's just

00:01:42.880 00:01:44.849
taking longer than what we had

00:01:45.780 00:01:48.419
anticipated also the fact that we're not

00:01:48.850 00:01:52.440
out here yet with our RV that has taken

00:01:53.380 00:01:55.319
at least two months longer than what

00:01:55.749 00:01:56.639
personally I thought it would take

00:01:56.920 00:01:59.309
because of the septic system a septic

00:01:59.350 00:02:02.760
system I mean it's not complicated but

00:02:03.549 00:02:06.679
we kind of also did some self-imposing

00:02:07.689 00:02:10.139
delays where we didn't want just a

00:02:10.929 00:02:13.950
standard septic tank we wanted something

00:02:14.200 00:02:17.070
different and we had to track down bids

00:02:17.319 00:02:19.860
for it and then we also went through the

00:02:20.790 00:02:24.780
supplier so with that being said the

00:02:24.970 00:02:27.780
good news is that we're going to get the

00:02:28.270 00:02:31.110
septic system holed up next week and

00:02:31.420 00:02:33.150
they're going to deliver our tank around

00:02:33.310 00:02:34.910
the 25th so that's good

00:02:35.610 00:02:37.910
once that done we will bring our RV out

00:02:38.190 00:02:39.830
here to the property so I'm excited

00:02:40.110 00:02:42.110
about having our little bun call you as

00:02:42.690 00:02:47.059
far as retirement goes and being having

00:02:47.340 00:02:48.740
been in a position in which I've made a

00:02:48.990 00:02:54.280
lots of decisions and valued decisions

00:02:55.290 00:02:58.190
that kind of impacted me personally and

00:02:58.500 00:03:00.710
some of how I husband as part of his

00:03:01.380 00:03:03.229
retirement he's continued to work even

00:03:03.510 00:03:06.140
if it's remotely he's been working and

00:03:06.569 00:03:08.660
with him working as an outstation

00:03:09.450 00:03:11.449
position that has taken a lots of his

00:03:11.760 00:03:13.280
time away from the project of building

00:03:13.410 00:03:16.250
the homestead so those are some of the

00:03:16.769 00:03:19.100
areas in which I've had some obstacles

00:03:19.650 00:03:21.740
he said some obstacles in building our

00:03:22.380 00:03:27.590
homestead and delays with my husband

00:03:27.840 00:03:29.030
working out station

00:03:29.640 00:03:32.810
he has spent a lot of time that he's

00:03:33.510 00:03:37.720
very well compensated for working in the

00:03:38.730 00:03:41.030
position or a similar position of what

00:03:41.130 00:03:42.890
he had before we left our home in Las

00:03:44.070 00:03:46.729
so that took time away from starting the

00:03:48.390 00:03:50.539
we've had some travel demands where

00:03:50.700 00:03:53.660
we've gone back to Las Vegas that lost

00:03:54.000 00:03:55.789
about a week and a half in which we had

00:03:55.829 00:03:57.949
to take care of business as well as get

00:03:58.100 00:04:01.280
some things and bring it back with us to

00:04:02.420 00:04:04.970
Texas we've had a couple of trips over

00:04:05.340 00:04:09.050
to East Texas to get supplies and visit

00:04:09.180 00:04:12.560
with families so between those weeks

00:04:12.930 00:04:17.420
being off weather and you'll know what

00:04:17.789 00:04:19.190
we all know what weather can do to

00:04:19.709 00:04:22.159
delight you it's been slower than what

00:04:22.380 00:04:24.770
we anticipated so if you look at our

00:04:25.320 00:04:27.380
schedule and what we had scheduled app

00:04:28.229 00:04:30.380
we're nowhere near being on that

00:04:30.960 00:04:34.070
schedule but we pretty much have a piece

00:04:34.350 00:04:35.880
about that

00:04:36.550 00:04:38.580
we know where we're here where we're

00:04:38.740 00:04:40.740
supposed to be that gives us a lots of

00:04:41.070 00:04:43.530
peace we've met some wonderful people

00:04:44.080 00:04:48.450
we're attending a local church we have

00:04:48.640 00:04:50.870
not killed each other in a small RV

00:04:51.880 00:04:53.640
that's a miracle in itself

00:04:54.250 00:04:56.130
so we've have we have lots of peace

00:04:56.500 00:04:59.610
about that so the videos are going to

00:04:59.770 00:05:02.400
keep coming they're going to show all

00:05:02.560 00:05:06.480
our projects as we complete them and I

00:05:06.550 00:05:09.210
just wanted to just let you know how we

00:05:09.460 00:05:12.660
were doing on the homestead we're doing

00:05:12.850 00:05:17.490
well we're on target under not our

00:05:18.280 00:05:20.070
schedule but I would say the Lord's

00:05:20.680 00:05:22.830
schedule so we're just going to keep on

00:05:23.410 00:05:25.920
plugging and enjoy this beautiful area

00:05:26.140 00:05:38.760
that we've come to thanks guys
