00:00:00.570 00:00:02.240
hello beautiful people think of turning

00:00:02.399 00:00:06.380
into my channel so this video of mine

00:00:06.600 00:00:08.089
it's gonna be sort of sweet that's not

00:00:08.250 00:00:09.650
how many idiots because as you can see

00:00:10.290 00:00:13.580
I'm in hospital when my main channel

00:00:14.460 00:00:16.460
here is just to raise awareness about my

00:00:16.650 00:00:19.189
heart condition I have what's called WP

00:00:19.710 00:00:21.080
w which is wolff-parkinson-white

00:00:22.039 00:00:24.140
syndrome it's a form of super

00:00:24.480 00:00:26.830
ventricular tachycardia where it causes

00:00:27.840 00:00:31.330
the top of my heart races very very fast

00:00:32.340 00:00:35.569
it's very rare it's under 20,000 cases a

00:00:35.610 00:00:41.299
year and for me I also have afib

00:00:41.820 00:00:45.229
so my with the afib my heart also skips

00:00:45.420 00:00:48.110
beats and it races from the bottom

00:00:48.809 00:00:50.779
husband's that was better to me so my

00:00:51.180 00:00:54.049
heart the electrical pathways with my

00:00:54.989 00:00:58.340
WPW causes my part to choose its own

00:00:58.949 00:01:00.500
accessory pathway and beat Holly wants

00:01:04.280 00:01:06.649
to but in a serious no I just want

00:01:06.810 00:01:10.300
people to be aware of the symptoms

00:01:11.310 00:01:14.390
you're when when you have an episode the

00:01:15.180 00:01:18.590
WPW or STV the first symptom for me

00:01:18.900 00:01:20.120
because I have a table I feel like I'm

00:01:20.340 00:01:23.090
being punched in the chest I have my

00:01:23.460 00:01:24.980
Apple watch to help me monitor my heart

00:01:25.350 00:01:26.870
also have this heart monitor but I

00:01:27.090 00:01:28.580
always know the signs

00:01:29.160 00:01:31.070
when I have an episode of STV I get

00:01:31.350 00:01:32.780
punched in the chest I get shortness of

00:01:32.970 00:01:35.060
breath I get lightheaded and I start

00:01:35.250 00:01:38.330
sweating and a lot of people think that

00:01:38.520 00:01:41.240
it's a panic attack and it's really

00:01:41.460 00:01:43.430
difficult to explain to people if it's

00:01:43.590 00:01:44.650
not a cardiologist and

00:01:45.660 00:01:47.120
electrophysiologist it's really a lot of

00:01:47.490 00:01:49.219
people don't know I've had many a panic

00:01:49.530 00:01:50.719
attacks because I suffer from depression

00:01:51.450 00:01:53.510
and anxiety and when I have a panic

00:01:54.140 00:01:57.590
attack my body goes numb I can't feel

00:01:57.869 00:02:00.260
anything in my fingers I can't talk I

00:02:01.020 00:02:03.800
can breathe and a lot of people like

00:02:03.960 00:02:05.180
you're just having a panic attack you're

00:02:05.340 00:02:06.940
just having a planet again and I'm not

00:02:07.950 00:02:09.109
it's not a panic attack

00:02:09.479 00:02:11.510
because I have to call it's a bagel

00:02:12.239 00:02:13.940
exercise I have to cough I have to stand

00:02:14.280 00:02:17.660
or I have to try to catch I'm trying to

00:02:17.850 00:02:21.979
get my rhythm back in - right trying to

00:02:22.110 00:02:23.479
get my heart back into the normal rhythm

00:02:24.120 00:02:26.510
which I don't have anyway

00:02:26.610 00:02:30.620
I can't get scared you know I have to be

00:02:30.810 00:02:33.440
careful what I do if I stand up too fast

00:02:33.900 00:02:37.300
it can make my heart race and ultimately

00:02:38.310 00:02:40.370
with my eighth day of my WWE I can pass

00:02:41.510 00:02:44.420
out the last three days my episodes have

00:02:44.750 00:02:47.780
been very very different because last

00:02:48.030 00:02:50.479
year I did have a catheter ablation but

00:02:50.580 00:02:53.479
they go up to growing in your legs or

00:02:53.549 00:02:54.860
the main arguments and they go to your

00:02:55.049 00:02:57.370
heart and they cauterize areas to try to

00:02:58.380 00:03:00.350
not have your heart conduct those

00:03:00.900 00:03:02.090
different accessory pathways and all

00:03:02.220 00:03:04.610
those extra electricity depending on the

00:03:04.860 00:03:08.930
severity of the accessory pathways the

00:03:09.360 00:03:11.900
surgery can last you know from four to

00:03:12.180 00:03:13.850
six hours

00:03:14.550 00:03:16.790
and then after the surgery I have to lay

00:03:16.980 00:03:20.480
out of bed flat for another four to six

00:03:20.820 00:03:22.550
hours because they did not want these

00:03:22.860 00:03:25.190
stitches to come out and caused me to

00:03:26.060 00:03:29.390
bleed fun night but last year I had to

00:03:29.730 00:03:32.360
cast our ablation it wasn't an emergency

00:03:32.640 00:03:35.780
situation is now because at this time I

00:03:36.210 00:03:38.720
have fainted multiple times I've got

00:03:40.280 00:03:44.750
lightheaded and they they're just it's

00:03:44.850 00:03:48.080
just not good this vide must I have I'm

00:03:48.450 00:03:49.520
scheduled for my second ablation

00:03:50.120 00:03:52.070
tomorrow Monday morning which will be

00:03:52.440 00:03:56.600
October 22nd of 2018 hopefully this one

00:03:57.209 00:03:59.570
will actually work right I just want to

00:03:59.700 00:04:02.090
go to school and be enough time and rest

00:04:02.400 00:04:03.770
I'm just trying to help people see their

00:04:04.020 00:04:09.910
best hello um but I just want people to

00:04:10.920 00:04:15.759
to understand that this condition is

00:04:16.769 00:04:20.300
it's frustrating you know I can't

00:04:21.030 00:04:23.720
exercise like I normally do because

00:04:23.910 00:04:26.360
after exercise my heart decides that it

00:04:26.400 00:04:31.070
wants to continue to race and I just

00:04:31.260 00:04:32.870
want people to be aware I'm going to be

00:04:33.240 00:04:35.000
saved I want you if you have any you

00:04:35.700 00:04:38.210
know heart racing as well as your heart

00:04:38.820 00:04:41.740
skipping beats you should see a doctor

00:04:42.750 00:04:45.320
because you can't you can't take these

00:04:45.390 00:04:47.879
things with a grain of salt

00:04:48.400 00:04:50.070
right now I'm hooked up to all sorts of

00:04:50.560 00:04:53.040
monitors and heart things and everything

00:04:53.939 00:04:57.149
and because I'm such a Tris right now I

00:04:57.430 00:04:59.610
can't even get up without the assistance

00:04:59.919 00:05:01.529
of somebody else because when I get up

00:05:02.080 00:05:04.769
my heart will shoot to 180 beats per

00:05:05.169 00:05:08.820
minute and I can faint and pass out but

00:05:10.650 00:05:14.820
I I'm trying to hang in there doing some

00:05:15.330 00:05:18.420
breathing to help me relax but if my my

00:05:18.969 00:05:23.360
episode starts you know I it's scary and

00:05:26.520 00:05:29.550
I can it feels like a panic attack but I

00:05:29.680 00:05:34.019
