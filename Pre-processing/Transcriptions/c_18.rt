00:00:01.260 00:00:04.720
hi everybody so for Parkinson's disease

00:00:05.730 00:00:07.309
neuropsychological testing cannot

00:00:07.849 00:00:11.120
actually diagnose this disorder because

00:00:11.460 00:00:13.039
most of the symptoms that occur in

00:00:13.650 00:00:17.200
Parkinson's disease are motor symptoms

00:00:18.210 00:00:23.330
once the disease is diagnosed and they

00:00:23.640 00:00:26.240
start looking into the deterioration of

00:00:26.490 00:00:29.960
the patient there are some cognitive

00:00:30.599 00:00:34.130
functions that can then be tested with

00:00:34.829 00:00:35.660
neurological or neuropsychological

00:00:38.210 00:00:42.790
testing so but one of the common neural

00:00:44.030 00:00:46.459
neuropsychological tests that are

00:00:47.160 00:00:48.170
performed with Parkinson's disease

00:00:49.039 00:00:52.459
patient is the Wisconsin card sorting

00:00:54.020 00:00:56.420
test now with Parkinson's disease

00:00:56.460 00:00:59.299
patients they're testing or they're

00:00:59.879 00:01:02.660
measuring the formation concept

00:01:03.170 00:01:07.520
formation so what this test does is it

00:01:07.890 00:01:12.740
asks a participant to sort 64 cards to

00:01:13.650 00:01:16.100
match either color the figure on the

00:01:16.350 00:01:19.460
card or the number of the figures on the

00:01:19.759 00:01:24.050
card but during the task the sorting

00:01:24.270 00:01:28.190
role does change but it changes without

00:01:28.950 00:01:32.300
the participant knowing so it either

00:01:32.610 00:01:36.679
goes from color to the figure on the

00:01:36.900 00:01:41.149
card or the number of figures on the

00:01:41.960 00:01:44.450
card the only thing that the participant

00:01:44.520 00:01:48.679
is told is whether the sorting rule is

00:01:49.110 00:01:53.600
correct or wrong as they're sorting the

00:01:53.850 00:01:56.090
one thing that or the primary symptoms

00:01:56.369 00:02:01.340
in Parkinson's disease is tremors or

00:02:02.479 00:02:06.770
shaking breaking muscles slow movement

00:02:07.039 00:02:12.170
or brady kinesia and also impaired

00:02:13.510 00:02:15.960
now the tremors or shaking usually

00:02:16.360 00:02:20.190
occurs in the extremities often the

00:02:20.530 00:02:25.190
hands or fingers there's they usually

00:02:26.200 00:02:28.770
have the pill rolling which is the

00:02:29.200 00:02:31.170
rolling of or the back-and-forth

00:02:31.359 00:02:33.089
movement of your finger your thumb and

00:02:33.250 00:02:38.539
your first finger then the rigid muscles

00:02:39.549 00:02:41.910
are just that their muscles get tight

00:02:42.340 00:02:44.789
and it occurred it can occur in any part

00:02:44.859 00:02:46.979
of the body and it limits the range of

00:02:47.530 00:02:49.440
motion which can be very painful for the

00:02:50.340 00:02:55.170
patients and for the slow movements or

00:02:55.239 00:03:02.369
the brady kinesia it is the it's very

00:03:03.609 00:03:06.770
it causes simple tasks such as eating or

00:03:07.780 00:03:09.990
walking across the room very difficult

00:03:10.379 00:03:13.460
and it's time-consuming for the patients

00:03:14.470 00:03:18.900
this then leads to patients shuffling

00:03:19.060 00:03:21.990
their feet or also what they consider

00:03:22.690 00:03:28.580
shuffling gait for Parkinson's disease

00:03:30.540 00:03:34.430
there isn't a cure but there is both

00:03:35.849 00:03:37.649
neurochemical medications and behavioral

00:03:38.109 00:03:41.819
changes that can help manage the

00:03:44.250 00:03:47.369
symptoms most are the medication that is

00:03:47.799 00:03:50.210
given to Parkinson's disease patients

00:03:51.220 00:03:55.469
can either increase or substitute for

00:03:56.340 00:03:59.250
dopamine and since dopamine can't really

00:03:59.500 00:04:03.349
be directly given to patients it's a

00:04:04.359 00:04:06.960
more of like a substitute or like I said

00:04:07.870 00:04:11.819
increases what we already have the

00:04:12.370 00:04:15.629
behavioral changes that can help with

00:04:16.060 00:04:18.180
the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are

00:04:19.030 00:04:23.670
things like changing or going and having

00:04:24.219 00:04:26.790
physical therapy and doing

00:04:27.759 00:04:30.870
aerobic exercises or yoga it really

00:04:31.240 00:04:33.089
helps with balance and stretching

00:04:33.720 00:04:39.390
muscles to alleviate some of the rigging

00:04:39.849 00:04:44.610
muscles and and then the impaired

00:04:47.069 00:04:50.400
balance though neuropsychological

00:04:51.400 00:04:53.490
testing cannot diagnose Parkinson's

00:04:54.310 00:04:58.430
disease it definitely can help assess

00:05:00.210 00:05:03.809
the deficits of cognitive functions such

00:05:03.849 00:05:06.480
as the diminishing capability of

00:05:06.699 00:05:08.760
performing tasks that require executive

00:05:09.690 00:05:13.680
functions as well as the learning and

00:05:14.199 00:05:17.219
retrieval abilities that may occur in

00:05:17.770 00:05:25.320
Parkinson's disease so the disorder is

00:05:25.930 00:05:28.200
definitely one that remains consistent

00:05:28.750 00:05:32.490
among each patient even though one

00:05:33.009 00:05:35.550
patient may get the tremors are that

00:05:35.800 00:05:39.839
more intensely than another patient that

00:05:40.000 00:05:42.779
has Parkinson's disease there they

00:05:43.210 00:05:45.089
always get the same symptoms there's

00:05:45.310 00:05:47.760
never one that doesn't get one or the

00:05:47.919 00:05:50.129
other they always for Parkinson's

00:05:50.199 00:05:52.920
disease get the tremors get the rigid

00:05:53.409 00:05:56.610
muscles and get the impaired balance and

00:05:56.919 00:06:02.219
the slow movement some of well the

00:06:02.409 00:06:04.980
outcome for Parkinson's disease is that

00:06:05.979 00:06:09.089
since there is no cure they really just

00:06:09.159 00:06:13.740
have to manage the symptoms it's is

00:06:15.900 00:06:18.390
pretty manageable if you're taking the

00:06:18.580 00:06:21.480
right actions to get the medication and

00:06:22.409 00:06:25.200
to make those behavioral changes or

00:06:25.690 00:06:30.749
lifestyle changes even though you don't

00:06:31.000 00:06:33.240
get rid of the disorder you still can

00:06:33.280 00:06:36.029
have some other normal life when you

00:06:36.389 00:06:38.640
have Parkinson's disease

00:06:39.160 00:06:43.860
so I hope everyone enjoyed that and have

00:06:43.900 00:06:46.560
a good day
