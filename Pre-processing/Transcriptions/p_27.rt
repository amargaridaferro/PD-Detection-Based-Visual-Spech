00:01:27.110 00:01:27.760
different for me this year because

there's not just I'm involved and I want

00:01:29.990 00:01:32.230

00:01:32.479 00:01:34.810
part is - tweak you know you there I'm

00:01:35.450 00:01:36.550

00:01:36.890 00:01:38.859
checking them the views and looking at

00:01:39.320 00:01:40.149
different people that you might know and

00:01:40.520 00:01:43.120
don't know on the new stuff about their

00:01:43.729 00:01:45.039

00:01:53.780 00:01:55.359
of the best things about today was I was

00:01:55.460 00:01:57.399

00:01:57.500 00:02:00.639

00:02:14.690 00:02:17.140

00:02:29.000 00:02:29.890
experience it for myself and what it's

00:02:30.020 00:02:32.020
like they're really nice environment I'm

00:02:32.270 00:02:32.880
really positive

00:02:32.950 00:02:34.410
they were really pleased with the

00:02:34.630 00:02:35.820
response it had to there we want weights

00:02:36.250 00:02:38.040
campaign which brings me to mine video

00:02:38.350 00:02:40.680
that I posted this morning thanks for

00:02:40.750 00:02:42.330
the kind comments and the response I got

00:02:42.459 00:02:44.040
from that it took me some time to do

00:02:44.230 00:02:45.660
that and tend to get my message across

00:02:46.000 00:02:48.930
well I don't mean it to worm to say hope

00:02:49.090 00:02:50.970
that was a tasteful way to do it and

00:02:51.130 00:02:54.780
then a dad's out there young folk and

00:02:55.450 00:02:57.390
parents like me and I hope that kind of

00:02:57.550 00:03:00.300
rang true and helps you explain to

00:03:00.489 00:03:03.059
others how it might be for you anyway so

00:03:03.370 00:03:04.380

call this doing the hotel on my own a

00:03:27.280 00:03:29.460
bit lonely really I'm sorry too Arush

00:03:30.130 00:03:32.370
Roslyn at Miss Illumina and by who think

00:03:32.470 00:03:34.259
about some unfazed book but just good so

00:03:34.300 00:03:35.729
I particular put down with my symptoms

00:03:36.430 00:03:37.440
it's been really tough to kind of manage

00:03:37.750 00:03:39.270
everything this afternoon you plan out

00:03:39.640 00:03:41.069
the best intentions or the best plans

00:03:41.829 00:03:43.800
there's my local you meant the best

00:03:44.079 00:03:45.750
plans you know with PD book these

00:03:45.940 00:03:46.830
symptoms kind of stop that from

00:03:48.489 00:03:50.610
hence no it's it's just about koalas

00:03:50.860 00:03:53.160
raids at night as I just got going start

00:03:53.260 00:03:55.190
