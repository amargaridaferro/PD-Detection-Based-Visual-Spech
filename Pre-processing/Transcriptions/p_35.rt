00:00:00.870 00:00:03.379
so I'm going to try and explain from my

00:00:03.570 00:00:05.780
own perspective what it feels like for

00:00:06.299 00:00:08.799
me living with heart disease every day

00:00:09.809 00:00:11.540
maybe this will create you can defeat

00:00:11.820 00:00:14.240
without simply that I fail to achieve

00:00:14.549 00:00:17.019
and possibly offer an alternative

00:00:18.029 00:00:20.830
perspective to the indifference and

00:00:21.840 00:00:25.960
distrust that I have created with people

00:00:26.970 00:00:31.040
this explanation is what I personally

00:00:33.350 00:00:36.860
believe about my own Parkinson's

00:00:37.440 00:00:40.459
experience and it may not line up to

00:00:41.460 00:00:47.260
what is known about Parkinson's but it's

00:00:48.500 00:00:57.170
an honest account of what it feels like

00:00:58.399 00:01:03.369
for me every day so here we go

00:01:04.379 00:01:05.810
dopamine is the chemical of the brain

00:01:06.060 00:01:08.630
uses to balance other chemicals the

00:01:09.000 00:01:11.060
reward system is greatly affected by the

00:01:11.310 00:01:13.700
loss of dopamine when a person with a

00:01:14.010 00:01:16.550
normal normal brain doesn't get what

00:01:16.650 00:01:19.490
they want it creates stress stress is an

00:01:20.100 00:01:22.460
unbalance of chemicals they don't want

00:01:23.130 00:01:25.330
yoyo is a one they get emotional as a

00:01:26.340 00:01:28.550
reaction to the stress they feel angry

00:01:28.619 00:01:31.310
or sad or whatever they accept it

00:01:31.619 00:01:33.859
deal with it the brain eventually goes

00:01:34.079 00:01:37.359
back to normal and it was balanced again

00:01:38.369 00:01:39.620
this doesn't happen to a Parkinson's

00:01:40.140 00:01:42.350
brain it's already unbalanced to begin

00:01:42.649 00:01:46.520
with less angry less sad less emotional

00:01:46.890 00:01:49.310
about everything all the time it's

00:01:49.590 00:01:53.420
called anhedonia and him--not anhedonia

00:01:53.990 00:01:57.160
is the ability to experience pleasure

00:01:58.170 00:02:00.679
I'm not just frozen physically I'm

00:02:01.350 00:02:03.350
frozen emotionally because my brain

00:02:03.600 00:02:06.560
doesn't make enough dopamine medications

00:02:06.869 00:02:09.979
add emotions back into the puzzle but

00:02:10.200 00:02:11.660
there's no way to regulate it in my

00:02:12.180 00:02:13.240
purposes brain

00:02:13.430 00:02:16.300
the dose of medication needed to keep my

00:02:17.290 00:02:20.820
legs is a lot more than my brain needs

00:02:21.830 00:02:23.530
society doesn't tolerate a person who

00:02:23.780 00:02:25.900
throws a hissy fit whenever they don't

00:02:26.150 00:02:29.050
get what they want but when I don't get

00:02:29.150 00:02:29.680
what I want

00:02:30.260 00:02:33.610
the emotional chaos from the excess of

00:02:34.520 00:02:37.900
dopamine due to my meds make it a huge

00:02:38.470 00:02:41.710
deal it's twice the reaction twice the

00:02:42.610 00:02:45.940
stress unbalance twice as bad and never

00:02:46.190 00:02:47.860
goes back to normal because there is no

00:02:49.250 00:02:51.430
the people closest to me have seen the

00:02:51.770 00:02:53.650
extreme side effects that caused me to

00:02:53.840 00:02:55.630
make irrational decisions and usually

00:02:55.820 00:02:57.150
end up with very serious and dramatic

00:02:58.540 00:03:00.580
consequences they all come to the same

00:03:01.100 00:03:03.130
conclusion that I'm mentally ill and

00:03:03.380 00:03:04.810
it's this illness that has a real cause

00:03:04.850 00:03:07.990
of the side effect not my meds and not

00:03:08.690 00:03:11.229
Parkinson's and they're right cute to

00:03:11.840 00:03:14.860
some extent I do live with a mental

00:03:15.400 00:03:17.560
illness but I don't experience symptoms

00:03:17.840 00:03:20.020
from this illness until I take

00:03:21.019 00:03:23.110
medications for Parkinson's so it's not

00:03:23.330 00:03:26.620
a mental illness causing my side effects

00:03:27.019 00:03:29.199
it's medications causing the escalation

00:03:29.690 00:03:31.990
of this mental illness and the

00:03:32.600 00:03:34.620
medications I take to treat this illness

00:03:35.630 00:03:37.780
only work on my Parkinson's is always

00:03:38.120 00:03:40.750
slightly met you two years ago I was

00:03:41.239 00:03:42.759
diagnosed with a bipolar two disorder

00:03:43.280 00:03:45.250
and I believe I've lived with this all

00:03:45.530 00:03:47.740
my life if the symptoms only revealed

00:03:48.370 00:03:50.560
themselves when overconsumption of

00:03:51.079 00:03:55.680
alcohol brought them out in me a result

00:03:56.690 00:03:59.080
this is why I had such a hard time

00:03:59.390 00:04:01.360
believing that I had a mental illness

00:04:01.850 00:04:03.479
and that this is where the side effects

00:04:04.489 00:04:06.910
came from the side effects mess up

00:04:07.579 00:04:09.940
manifests themselves as hypomania most

00:04:10.519 00:04:12.670
most of the time which is basically an

00:04:13.280 00:04:15.819
extension of my bipolar disorder the

00:04:16.190 00:04:18.219
main symptoms of hypomania that I feel

00:04:18.440 00:04:21.659
on a regular basis are increased in

00:04:22.669 00:04:23.740
persistent disinhibition

00:04:24.560 00:04:26.050
decreased need for sleep

00:04:26.570 00:04:29.080
increasing confidence flights of ideas

00:04:30.130 00:04:33.240
and heightened irritant irritability I

00:04:34.250 00:04:36.670
live with - hypomania every time I take

00:04:36.710 00:04:39.520
a pill but the problems become extreme

00:04:40.160 00:04:43.030
when - man becomes full-blown many this

00:04:43.220 00:04:45.700
is caused by our medication but the

00:04:45.830 00:04:48.520
other medication is the only way to keep

00:04:48.590 00:04:51.370
my legs medicated enough so that I can

00:04:52.389 00:04:54.820
walk it's important to understand that

00:04:55.430 00:04:57.070
over medication does not mean I'm

00:04:57.350 00:04:59.020
abusing my meds or taking more than I

00:04:59.380 00:05:01.870
need it means that despite taking my

00:05:02.479 00:05:03.670
medications exactly the way my doctor

00:05:04.160 00:05:05.860
prescribes them and it's by only taking

00:05:06.260 00:05:08.190
enough to successfully treat my symptoms

00:05:09.200 00:05:10.810
there is still too much dopamine in my

00:05:11.800 00:05:13.870
brain it's been a constant battle with

00:05:14.479 00:05:16.510
side-effects and paralysis but there are

00:05:16.729 00:05:18.670
also behavioral symptoms of Parkinson's

00:05:18.740 00:05:21.010
that make everything worse which brings

00:05:21.169 00:05:24.969
me back to doping it's this deregulation

00:05:25.370 00:05:27.670
of dopamine that causes issues that are

00:05:27.940 00:05:30.840
called impulse control disorders

00:05:31.850 00:05:33.250
compulsive obsessive and risk-taking

00:05:33.860 00:05:36.670
behaviors are real issues caused by too

00:05:36.979 00:05:39.760
much dopamine in my brain it's this

00:05:40.580 00:05:46.210
excess dopamine that causes my bipolar

00:05:46.460 00:05:50.650
two disorder to escalate or transform

00:05:51.700 00:05:55.060
into hypomania hypomania is

00:05:55.820 00:05:57.610
distinguished from mania by the absence

00:05:57.680 00:06:00.670
of psychotic symptoms so it may seem

00:06:01.010 00:06:03.070
like the unusual behaviors that I engage

00:06:03.610 00:06:06.670
in sometimes are crazy but it's actually

00:06:07.270 00:06:09.820
not insanely can be described as not

00:06:10.070 00:06:11.409
knowing the difference between right or

00:06:11.720 00:06:14.260
wrong and although the irrational

00:06:14.930 00:06:16.570
decisions I sometimes make and then the

00:06:16.940 00:06:19.150
behavior change changes that can happen

00:06:20.090 00:06:22.000
if my hypomania becomes full-blown mania

00:06:22.910 00:06:25.060
can seem crazy or insane but it's not

00:06:25.190 00:06:27.580
the same even when I'm manic and out of

00:06:27.860 00:06:29.529
control emotionally I know the

00:06:29.870 00:06:31.629
difference between right or wrong but

00:06:31.789 00:06:34.690
I'm just too impulsive to change my

00:06:36.980 00:06:38.830
it's this impulsiveness that is the root

00:06:39.020 00:06:40.810
of every other behavioral issue that I

00:06:41.350 00:06:44.140
had when I became manic it's never my

00:06:44.420 00:06:46.780
goal to hurt anyone or do anything wrong

00:06:47.450 00:06:48.970
but I'm so overwhelmed by so many

00:06:49.610 00:06:51.880
emotions during these times that I can

00:06:52.040 00:06:55.540
do little to stop it so on top of the

00:06:55.760 00:06:59.500
loss of the ability to walk in the

00:06:59.900 00:07:02.680
complete emotional apathy I feel I also

00:07:03.110 00:07:06.160
contend with impulsive behaviors and

00:07:06.500 00:07:08.170
when you throw the extreme mood disorder

00:07:08.540 00:07:11.350
side effects into the mix it's like

00:07:11.690 00:07:14.800
throwing gas on a fire this is a typical

00:07:14.990 00:07:18.220
day for me I wake up and have about five

00:07:18.440 00:07:19.720
minutes of normal movement before

00:07:20.330 00:07:23.200
symptoms symptoms show up first thing I

00:07:23.270 00:07:25.210
do is take a pill and then I freeze up

00:07:25.400 00:07:26.470
I'm stuck to a chair

00:07:27.410 00:07:28.960
thirty minutes later the meds kick in

00:07:29.300 00:07:32.440
and I can walk you walk again it's like

00:07:32.600 00:07:35.560
my brain is jolted back to life the

00:07:35.930 00:07:37.450
reward system in my brain becomes

00:07:38.030 00:07:39.850
unstable due to the influx of dopamine

00:07:40.580 00:07:41.680
that wasn't there before

00:07:42.290 00:07:44.410
so I impulsively and almost desperately

00:07:44.750 00:07:47.020
searched for anything create a feedback

00:07:47.210 00:07:49.870
of satisfaction I become very impulsive

00:07:50.470 00:07:52.330
and obsessively start looking for an

00:07:52.670 00:07:54.580
outlet but a certain number arrival of

00:07:55.130 00:07:58.060
emotions back to my brain that outlet is

00:07:58.610 00:08:00.490
usually several long drawn out in a

00:08:00.710 00:08:02.410
really dramatic text about nothing

00:08:02.650 00:08:05.020
really know I can possibly type to

00:08:05.330 00:08:06.930
anyone I can find any face but without

00:08:07.940 00:08:10.180
even getting their response at the same

00:08:10.460 00:08:13.000
time all this is going on my bipolar

00:08:13.520 00:08:15.390
disorder transforms in the hypomania and

00:08:16.400 00:08:17.770
the side-effects became more severe

00:08:18.500 00:08:20.830
every time I take my next dose for the

00:08:21.020 00:08:24.040
rest of the day it would be like if you

00:08:24.350 00:08:27.790
woke up into the shot and bought it and

00:08:28.430 00:08:29.740
continued taking the shot every three

00:08:30.340 00:08:32.440
hours by the end of the day you'd be

00:08:33.460 00:08:36.520
smashed and that's kind of how I feel I

00:08:37.490 00:08:39.300
feel smashed but in the end of every day

00:08:40.310 00:08:42.969
but most days I successfully suppress

00:08:43.250 00:08:45.330
the escalation of mental and emotional

00:08:46.720 00:08:48.910
instability by avoiding in limiting

00:08:50.449 00:08:52.360
but with all of this excess emotion and

00:08:52.639 00:08:54.579
mental activity I'm like a time bomb

00:08:55.160 00:08:58.240
waiting to go up and the trigger is

00:08:58.839 00:09:01.150
stress anything that stresses me out is

00:09:01.850 00:09:04.300
magnified and a simple disagreement with

00:09:04.730 00:09:05.560
anything or anyone

00:09:06.079 00:09:07.600
can cause me to explode and become

00:09:08.389 00:09:10.360
self-destructive and among flame

00:09:10.910 00:09:13.500
retardent too much stress can cause the

00:09:14.510 00:09:16.150
hypomania to become full-blown mania and

00:09:16.940 00:09:18.610
that's when like me behaviors becoming

00:09:19.839 00:09:27.400
irrational so that's an explanation what

00:09:27.529 00:09:30.490
it feels like to live with with

00:09:31.130 00:09:36.129
Parkinsons for me and I hope somebody

00:09:37.130 00:09:40.389
you know somewhere down the road can

00:09:40.760 00:09:46.660
maybe watch this and gain gain some

00:09:49.899 00:09:57.670
insight about what Parkinson's really is
