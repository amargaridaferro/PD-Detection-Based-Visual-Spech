00:00:02.939 00:00:05.030
hello again well of course the weeks

00:00:05.339 00:00:08.600
League went by in a flash and I was

00:00:09.210 00:00:12.080
subsequently told to report to HMS

00:00:14.240 00:00:16.790
I wish once again turned out to be a

00:00:18.750 00:00:21.920
the landlocked ship on the west coast of

00:00:22.769 00:00:23.950
England and near a town called

00:00:24.960 00:00:27.950
Warrington in Lancashire and so of

00:00:28.199 00:00:32.930
course I do Lee did and well but when

00:00:33.329 00:00:35.479
when we when we got there I could see

00:00:35.670 00:00:37.030
that the whole atmosphere was completely

00:00:38.040 00:00:40.580
different to the dilapidated conditions

00:00:40.829 00:00:43.430
that we'd had before in our sort of boot

00:00:43.829 00:00:48.830
camp and that there was white posts the

00:00:49.200 00:00:51.700
line roads and there were even

00:00:52.710 00:00:56.060
cultivated areas of gardens and so it

00:00:56.250 00:00:58.450
was very much more pleasant and a

00:00:59.460 00:01:02.470
completely different atmosphere and

00:01:03.480 00:01:05.780
there would be about 20 of rosacea thing

00:01:06.000 00:01:08.359
and we were still accommodated in the

00:01:08.820 00:01:11.210
wooden in a wooden building but this

00:01:11.549 00:01:14.600
time there was a stove in the middle of

00:01:14.909 00:01:18.730
the of the Roman so we had better

00:01:19.740 00:01:21.710
accommodation and I think you can

00:01:21.990 00:01:24.679
imagine when 20 young people get

00:01:24.869 00:01:26.719
together there's always one extrovert

00:01:28.070 00:01:30.350
and probably somebody who could play an

00:01:31.049 00:01:33.350
instrument and and there was one

00:01:34.140 00:01:36.590
Welshman who could sing very well and he

00:01:36.960 00:01:43.940
was always doing a version of what

00:01:44.280 00:01:49.550
season him I come and perfidia by yeah

00:01:50.310 00:01:52.399
so it was much better but of course we

00:01:52.470 00:01:54.859
still had the same routines he would

00:01:55.140 00:01:57.830
have on the ship and we were awakened at

00:01:58.140 00:02:01.969
about 6 a.m. by a channel and we went to

00:02:02.399 00:02:03.980
wash and then dress and then to

00:02:04.560 00:02:10.940
breakfast and horn was whatever I didn't

00:02:12.060 00:02:13.130
understand or could see anything

00:02:13.860 00:02:18.800
happening and but we had many interviews

00:02:19.670 00:02:23.840
and tests and I think the whole thing

00:02:24.090 00:02:27.740
was to decide what sort of position you

00:02:28.050 00:02:29.780
would take when you were sent to a

00:02:30.690 00:02:35.060
proper warship like say a gunner or cook

00:02:35.430 00:02:38.690
or a radio operator or a signalman or

00:02:39.690 00:02:42.800
something but it was decided that hi and

00:02:43.170 00:02:47.650
I think six others would be sent to

00:02:48.660 00:02:51.770
train as radar mechanics and of course

00:02:52.320 00:02:53.990
radar in those days was in his very

00:02:54.120 00:02:57.020
early stages and so that is what

00:02:57.870 00:03:02.030
happened and we were sent to Aberdeen in

00:03:02.209 00:03:06.520
Scotland and there we were housed in

00:03:07.880 00:03:10.100
domestic bed and breakfast really I

00:03:13.880 00:03:17.720
suppose and we attended a college called

00:03:18.330 00:03:22.009
Robert Gordon College we didn't allow

00:03:22.080 00:03:24.380
the same freedoms as maybe other

00:03:25.140 00:03:27.590
students who could choose their own time

00:03:28.380 00:03:30.199
so to attend their lectures and things

00:03:30.540 00:03:33.560
we we had to report I think in 9 a.m.

00:03:34.519 00:03:38.890
and there of course we we learned

00:03:39.900 00:03:44.860
eventually about the wonders of radar we

00:03:45.870 00:03:49.850
had many many lectures and we learned

00:03:50.070 00:03:53.300
about radios we built simple radios and

00:03:53.519 00:03:55.960
then more complicated radios which were

00:03:56.970 00:04:00.020
operated by valves and resistors and and

00:04:00.360 00:04:05.090
things and eventually of course passed

00:04:05.489 00:04:09.229
out as as radar mechanics and then

00:04:10.110 00:04:15.050
returned to HMS Collinwood where we

00:04:15.390 00:04:17.539
would be I suppose

00:04:17.970 00:04:21.080
told what we were going to do next so I

00:04:21.390 00:04:23.230
tell you about that next time

00:04:25.010 00:04:29.900
but it was apart from the fact of having

00:04:30.360 00:04:34.370
to have very very weak polish college

00:04:35.340 00:04:38.270
laced with so much salt it was all a

00:04:38.490 00:04:41.360
very very pleasant held very very

00:04:41.730 00:04:45.290
pleasant experience really so until next

00:04:45.660 00:04:48.560
time goodbye
