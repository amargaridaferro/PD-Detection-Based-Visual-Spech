00:00:32.739 00:00:33.720
somebody without Parkinson's but

00:00:34.510 00:00:38.160
Parkinson's is quite challenging and I'm

00:00:38.620 00:00:40.560
happy to share something which for me is

00:00:41.260 00:00:43.020
helpful I have Parkinson's you people

00:00:43.210 00:00:44.610
with Parkinson's can probably recognize

00:00:45.129 00:00:47.040
that my jaw kind of twists around I have

00:00:47.079 00:00:51.660
a bit of a shake I'm on lever duck I've

00:00:52.229 00:01:01.500
had Parkinson's for two three years what

00:01:01.540 00:01:04.429
I want to do is introduce you to a

00:01:05.439 00:01:09.660
postural exercises Parkinson's mix that

00:01:10.119 00:01:13.800
makes my torso my body Nick head stiff

00:01:14.080 00:01:29.069
and my posture one way to deal with this

00:01:29.320 00:01:31.980
is to lie flat on the floor and just

00:01:32.320 00:01:34.709
allow the gravity to flatten your body

00:01:35.020 00:01:38.609
so your your head and neck and back

00:01:40.229 00:01:43.349
aligned to the system this gravity

00:01:44.049 00:01:46.109
alignment lying flat on the back I put

00:01:46.270 00:01:50.309
this under my spine run it from the base

00:01:50.530 00:01:54.719
of my spine up to the neck and then just

00:01:54.939 00:01:57.419
relax and let the body weight a line in

00:01:57.549 00:02:01.050
the whole body I'll show you how I do

00:02:01.409 00:02:05.099
this place the noodle the foam noodle

00:02:05.380 00:02:06.899
you can roll up a piece of towel which

00:02:07.060 00:02:09.510
is quite effective and it's anything

00:02:11.940 00:02:14.160
soft rolled up towel at the base of the

00:02:14.760 00:02:21.030
spine lay back and just relax let the

00:02:22.980 00:02:26.550
weight gravity

00:02:27.560 00:02:31.600
see cracks in the neck kind of an

00:02:32.120 00:02:39.890
opening in the chest

00:02:40.590 00:03:03.990
just waiting relaxing

00:03:05.000 00:03:11.170
it's the floor what I like to do down my

00:03:11.390 00:03:12.729
head is just touching the floor doesn't

00:03:12.920 00:03:16.300

00:03:16.459 00:03:18.940
weight of my head is not my neck is kind

00:03:19.069 00:03:20.979
of quite stiff so there's the full wages

00:03:21.380 00:03:23.650
not on the floor um I can roll to the

00:03:23.780 00:03:27.850
side and pull out the foam your noodle

00:03:27.920 00:03:31.240
or the rolled-up towel and just let my

00:03:31.430 00:03:33.280
whole body sink into the floor under the

00:03:34.900 00:03:39.610
carpet relaxing okay this is something

00:03:39.650 00:03:44.289
