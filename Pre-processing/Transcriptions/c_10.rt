00:00:02.110 00:00:03.030
so I don't know how much more evidence

00:00:03.700 00:00:07.499
people need about medical marijuana to

00:00:07.900 00:00:09.839
stop opposing it

00:00:11.040 00:00:13.440
and again it's just ignorance it's just

00:00:14.370 00:00:17.179
amazing its corporate greed of course

00:00:18.189 00:00:19.970
the opioid companies don't want the

00:00:20.980 00:00:23.130
competition from medical marijuana they

00:00:23.200 00:00:27.839
do not want it the alcohol industry does

00:00:28.029 00:00:29.400
not want the competition from marijuana

00:00:30.220 00:00:32.519
there's lots of money big money behind

00:00:32.980 00:00:34.650
keeping marijuana illegal which is why

00:00:34.960 00:00:36.389
sick people can't get it because they

00:00:36.609 00:00:40.020
buy politicians you know guys like Chris

00:00:40.170 00:00:42.150
Christie very easy to buy a guy like

00:00:42.339 00:00:45.090
that no integrity so there's a movie

00:00:45.309 00:00:47.579
called ride with Larry and this this guy

00:00:47.800 00:00:50.910
here Larry is a retired police captain

00:00:51.309 00:00:54.840
who's got Parkinson's and they're gonna

00:00:55.120 00:00:56.819
this is the first time they're gonna try

00:00:56.859 00:00:58.169
and give him some marijuana his first

00:00:58.480 00:01:00.239
time to see if it helps us his

00:01:00.940 00:01:23.959
Parkinson's let's take a look shall we

00:01:24.969 00:01:26.520
the best way to take it is to put it on

00:01:26.920 00:01:34.630
your tongue and rub it the new cheek

00:01:35.640 00:01:36.680
don't do too much you're gonna be asleep

00:01:37.110 00:01:41.510
on that then no you should do no don't

00:01:41.790 00:01:45.290
try to communicate just relax see what

00:01:46.890 00:01:49.310
we know from animal experiments that the

00:01:49.830 00:01:51.620
Indulgence cannabinoid system is very

00:01:52.230 00:01:54.050
important in regulating motor activity

00:01:54.600 00:01:56.060
the very type of activity that is

00:01:56.760 00:01:58.760
impaired in Parkinson's disease from

00:01:59.130 00:02:00.880
animal experiments we also know that

00:02:01.890 00:02:03.920
boosting certain branches of the

00:02:04.770 00:02:06.350
endocannabinoid system is helpful in

00:02:06.570 00:02:09.220
relieving symptoms of Parkinson's

00:02:10.230 00:02:12.590
finally from anecdotal information we

00:02:12.810 00:02:15.350
know that certain patients who smoke

00:02:16.100 00:02:18.350
marijuana experience relief of their

00:02:18.420 00:02:24.250
symptoms I think you're calm down

00:02:25.430 00:02:28.370
amazing he used just a single drop and

00:02:29.310 00:02:31.640
his hands afterwards were rock steady

00:02:31.950 00:02:39.260
and the dyskinesia left it works most of

00:02:39.330 00:02:54.910
the time oh did you guys see lunch like

00:02:55.920 00:03:01.970
really easy angry that thank you my home

00:03:03.140 00:03:06.110
state the number one frustration that I

00:03:06.450 00:03:10.130
have is knowing that there is this

00:03:10.950 00:03:12.949
untapped potential comes from what

00:03:13.260 00:03:15.890
marijuana Steve is teaching us to

00:03:16.380 00:03:18.890
generate new medicines and being stuck

00:03:19.500 00:03:22.550
because of financial issues or

00:03:23.459 00:03:25.340
politically issues that is extremely

00:03:25.920 00:03:27.680
frustrating we now know that medical

00:03:28.850 00:03:31.790
marijuana controls dyskinesia and yet

00:03:31.950 00:03:38.090
it's not it's not available to us so

00:03:38.250 00:03:39.710
that's from that movie ride with Larry

00:03:40.500 00:03:41.660
so check that out and here's what it

00:03:41.850 00:03:43.610
says about it Larry just doesn't live

00:03:43.739 00:03:46.039
with Parkinson's he rises above it after

00:03:46.079 00:03:47.280
a 20-year battle with

00:03:47.530 00:03:49.199
markinson's Larry has exhausted every

00:03:49.810 00:03:51.030
conventional method of treatment every

00:03:51.340 00:03:55.319
drug and even brain surgery refusing to

00:03:55.480 00:03:56.789
give up he seeks alternatives

00:03:57.459 00:03:58.649
discovering the untapped benefits of

00:03:59.200 00:04:01.410
exercise and medical marijuana now Larry

00:04:01.599 00:04:04.410
will attempt to the unthinkable a 300

00:04:04.599 00:04:06.599
mile bike ride across South Dakota a

00:04:06.970 00:04:08.729
journey of hope for anyone facing a

00:04:09.459 00:04:12.240
life-altering illness in this intimate

00:04:12.909 00:04:14.729
portrait of courage love and community

00:04:15.549 00:04:17.249
Larry Smith refuses to give up proving

00:04:17.530 00:04:20.999
that if you love life you will fight for

00:04:22.800 00:04:26.370
it so anytime you find someone who's on

00:04:26.500 00:04:28.200
the fence about medical marijuana he's

00:04:28.389 00:04:31.050
shown this that's a retired police

00:04:31.320 00:04:33.300
captain 20 years he's been living like

00:04:33.690 00:04:38.900
this takes marijuana and he has relief

00:04:40.440 00:04:44.939
and anybody who's against this is has

00:04:45.160 00:04:48.480
been manipulated you've been manipulated

00:04:48.669 00:04:51.570
I still know people who go who drink in

00:04:51.789 00:04:52.740
front of their kids they drink alcohol

00:04:53.169 00:04:54.210
which we all know that's the thing

00:04:54.310 00:04:55.680
that's gonna hurt your kids if anything

00:04:56.440 00:04:58.560
alcohol caught 50 50 percent of all car

00:04:59.020 00:05:02.820
crashes involve alcohol so we all know

00:05:02.919 00:05:03.960
if your kid's gonna get hurt it's gonna

00:05:04.330 00:05:05.399
because of how people drink in front of

00:05:05.500 00:05:06.899
their kids and I don't go do you ever

00:05:07.180 00:05:08.279
smoke pot oh no I wouldn't smoke pot in

00:05:08.349 00:05:13.379
front of my kid do you mean the drug

00:05:13.539 00:05:15.629
that doesn't hurt them yeah I know but

00:05:15.789 00:05:18.270
it's just this is the you know I've been

00:05:18.699 00:05:20.010
indoctrinated and other people's

00:05:20.260 00:05:21.270
thoughts have been jammed in my head

00:05:21.400 00:05:24.170
about this and I can't get past them so

00:05:25.180 00:05:26.460
I drink in front of my kids I don't

00:05:26.620 00:05:28.170
smoke pot in front of my kids that's

00:05:28.330 00:05:31.860
what that is so anytime you see someone

00:05:32.409 00:05:34.830
who doesn't know where is aunty medical

00:05:35.229 00:05:37.710
marijuana show them this will it

00:05:38.080 00:05:39.240
convince them no cuz those people are

00:05:39.760 00:05:41.159
[&nbsp;__&nbsp;] stupid but at least you could

00:05:41.409 00:05:46.439
show them this I've all I have a big

00:05:46.750 00:05:48.960
advocate of marijuana medical marijuana

00:05:49.210 00:05:53.260
and registrar marijuana

00:05:54.270 00:05:56.000
it helped make me a much better comedian

00:05:56.220 00:05:57.470
I don't smoke pot before I go onstage

00:05:58.110 00:05:58.970
anymore but there was a time where I

00:05:59.220 00:06:00.500
couldn't go on stage without smoking it

00:06:01.140 00:06:02.540
because I couldn't be as funny it made

00:06:02.730 00:06:05.480
me a much better performer I was a much

00:06:05.880 00:06:08.180
stiffer performer and then I started

00:06:08.250 00:06:09.590
working with the marijuana logs and you

00:06:09.690 00:06:12.650
have to smoke before you go on and I was

00:06:12.900 00:06:14.780
scared to do it but boy really help help

00:06:14.910 00:06:18.170
me grow and now I don't need it and all

00:06:18.210 00:06:19.820
I have is the negative effects of it

00:06:19.980 00:06:21.260
which sometimes you forget jokes or

00:06:21.330 00:06:22.820
whatever so I don't do any more before I

00:06:22.950 00:06:26.210
go onstage because I don't need it to

00:06:26.340 00:06:26.750
get there

00:06:27.270 00:06:34.030
okay I'm there look at me I'm there so

00:06:35.040 00:06:36.830
I'm a big big proponent of marijuana and

00:06:37.410 00:06:40.100
the fact that Barack Obama 8 years still

00:06:40.410 00:06:42.170
kept it as a Schedule one drug is just

00:06:42.390 00:06:45.050
