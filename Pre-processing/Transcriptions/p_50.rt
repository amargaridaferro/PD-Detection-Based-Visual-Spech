00:00:03.540 00:00:05.090
researchers are beginning to understand

00:00:06.000 00:00:08.000
the neurological basis for why

00:00:08.849 00:00:10.669
activities like crocheting and knitting

00:00:11.250 00:00:14.870
are so good for the brain one reason

00:00:15.660 00:00:18.140
crocheting and activities like it are so

00:00:18.869 00:00:21.230
therapeutic is because these activities

00:00:22.109 00:00:24.500
engage so many parts of the brain at one

00:00:25.760 00:00:28.429
time when you call on all parts of your

00:00:28.619 00:00:30.980
brain it stimulates the neural

00:00:31.740 00:00:33.830
connections and keeps those connections

00:00:34.500 00:00:38.780
firing efficiently and quickly the more

00:00:39.000 00:00:42.590
we use these connections as we age the

00:00:42.870 00:00:45.440
more likely they are to stay intact and

00:00:46.200 00:00:47.869
it decreases the probability of

00:00:48.620 00:00:52.910
developing cognition problems another

00:00:53.219 00:00:55.639
reason they are so therapeutic is that

00:00:56.309 00:00:59.150
repetitive activities like crocheting or

00:00:59.699 00:01:01.459
knitting or quilting or any other type

00:01:01.670 00:01:05.060
of repetitive activity can release

00:01:05.549 00:01:08.600
serotonin in the body serotonin

00:01:09.570 00:01:12.490
increases your pain threshold higher

00:01:13.500 00:01:15.590
serotonin levels also play an important

00:01:15.780 00:01:19.130
role in controlling depression which is

00:01:19.170 00:01:22.390
a terrible part of Parkinson's disease

00:01:23.400 00:01:25.940
the main feature of Parkinson's is the

00:01:26.880 00:01:28.179
deficiency of dopamine in the brain

00:01:29.189 00:01:32.810
which causes depression in addition to

00:01:32.939 00:01:35.200
the loss of dopamine your

00:01:36.210 00:01:38.410
neurotransmitter systems are also

00:01:40.369 00:01:42.760
degenerating so as soon as you start

00:01:43.770 00:01:45.350
experiencing depression which is

00:01:45.990 00:01:48.200
normally very early on in the disease

00:01:48.899 00:01:51.139
it's very important for you to find a

00:01:51.450 00:01:53.690
good psychiatrist who can prescribe

00:01:54.860 00:01:57.319
appropriate medications to correct that

00:01:57.869 00:02:00.590
imbalance in your brain when you're

00:02:00.899 00:02:03.410
feeling depressed is not a character

00:02:03.719 00:02:05.810
flaw and it's not a personal failure

00:02:06.659 00:02:08.990
it's a physical problem in your

00:02:11.030 00:02:13.790
rain there is a stigma attached to

00:02:14.460 00:02:15.770
dealing with depression and mental

00:02:16.410 00:02:18.260
illness and it's hard to admit that you

00:02:18.480 00:02:20.960
need to consult with a psychiatrist but

00:02:21.510 00:02:23.900
it's critical that you make that part of

00:02:24.270 00:02:27.050
your treatment plan there is no doubt

00:02:27.120 00:02:29.420
that your self-esteem takes a beating

00:02:29.970 00:02:31.670
when you're dealing with Parkinson's and

00:02:32.550 00:02:34.550
that's just another reason the healing

00:02:34.709 00:02:37.910
arts are even more important for me

00:02:38.280 00:02:40.340
there are four things about crocheting

00:02:40.830 00:02:42.770
that contribute to the healing process

00:02:43.580 00:02:46.100
the rhythmic repetitive movement of

00:02:46.650 00:02:48.740
crocheting is a kind of meditation for

00:02:48.800 00:02:52.070
me where I'm completely focused on the

00:02:52.500 00:02:55.250
moment when you're focused on the moment

00:02:55.830 00:02:57.920
you can't be upset about things that

00:02:58.260 00:03:01.190
happened in the past or you can't worry

00:03:01.530 00:03:03.590
about things that are going to happen in

00:03:03.720 00:03:07.010
the future you can only be right here in

00:03:07.410 00:03:09.979
this moment experiencing what's in front

00:03:10.140 00:03:13.940
of you number two is crafting as a

00:03:14.519 00:03:18.110
creative act of self expression we need

00:03:19.019 00:03:21.470
creativity in our lives creativity is

00:03:21.900 00:03:24.970
what makes life interesting and fun I

00:03:25.980 00:03:28.190
get a lot of enjoyment from creating

00:03:28.739 00:03:31.940
something beautiful from just an idea so

00:03:32.220 00:03:34.340
being creative and being proud of what

00:03:34.530 00:03:39.050
you have created lifts the spirits I'll

00:03:39.450 00:03:43.400
show you a couple of projects i just

00:03:43.860 00:03:47.860
finished i did this springtime wreath

00:03:48.870 00:03:57.530
made from pastel colored cat toys

00:03:58.540 00:04:01.860
another project I worked on recently was

00:04:02.050 00:04:05.970
the solar system I tried to put all the

00:04:06.490 00:04:14.699
planets in their correct orbits and I

00:04:15.180 00:04:24.300
also crocheted my husband's head

00:04:25.310 00:04:28.780
so the third thing is crafting teaches

00:04:28.970 00:04:32.680
you to visualize an end product and then

00:04:32.960 00:04:35.370
work on that project to completion

00:04:36.380 00:04:38.469
instead of working toward the final end

00:04:39.110 00:04:41.620
goal on a large project break it down

00:04:42.169 00:04:44.020
into smaller chunks that can be

00:04:44.479 00:04:47.740
completed more quickly this helps you

00:04:47.990 00:04:50.250
deal with concentration problems and

00:04:51.260 00:04:54.790
cognitive issues a crafting project can

00:04:55.039 00:04:58.200
also help you practice problem solving

00:04:59.210 00:05:01.420
there never seems to be a pattern for

00:05:01.699 00:05:07.090
anything I want to crochet so I need to

00:05:07.340 00:05:10.840
figure out the end result and then

00:05:11.539 00:05:14.170
determine the steps to accomplish that

00:05:14.570 00:05:18.520
end result so we can start small by

00:05:19.100 00:05:21.310
solving problems in our craft and it

00:05:21.979 00:05:23.800
reminds us that we can solve the bigger

00:05:24.440 00:05:27.969
problems in our life the fourth thing is

00:05:28.280 00:05:29.860
that crafting connects you to other

00:05:30.639 00:05:33.250
people feeling a sense of connection to

00:05:33.440 00:05:36.100
people around you contributes to the

00:05:36.530 00:05:39.279
healing process every Wednesday at our

00:05:39.590 00:05:42.070
condo we have a craft corner for

00:05:42.500 00:05:44.500
everyone brings whatever they're working

00:05:44.660 00:05:46.870
on at the time and we just sit together

00:05:47.360 00:05:49.900
and visit for a couple of hours so my

00:05:50.599 00:05:52.089
connections are to my friends I craft

00:05:52.490 00:05:55.900
with the people I crochet items for and

00:05:56.599 00:05:58.589
the charity events I create aya

00:05:59.599 00:06:03.610
contribute my crafting to when I think

00:06:03.770 00:06:06.550
of creativity and the scriptures I think

00:06:06.710 00:06:10.890
of Ephesians 2 10 which speaks of God's

00:06:11.900 00:06:14.670
creativity for we are his workmanship

00:06:16.120 00:06:21.250
created in Christ Jesus for good works
