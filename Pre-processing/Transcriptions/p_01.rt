00:00:00.960 00:00:04.039
greetings and salutations this is Rick

00:00:04.470 00:00:07.760
Koppel and I'm checking in on my video

00:00:07.799 00:00:10.549
blog for Parkinson's so get you some

00:00:10.710 00:00:13.459
updates let you know what's going on so

00:00:14.280 00:00:16.670
let's get into it but we got a lot of

00:00:17.039 00:00:20.750
stuff to go over real quick one thing I

00:00:20.880 00:00:22.250
need to go over is the a minute and

00:00:22.680 00:00:26.570
trial and my progress on the disability

00:00:27.119 00:00:30.589
benefits and what all that means health

00:00:31.140 00:00:33.620
insurance and also my testing and seeing

00:00:34.320 00:00:36.290
timing the sentiment to help dyskinesia

00:00:36.510 00:00:38.840
a little better which I've got a minor

00:00:39.180 00:00:40.639
touch of it right at the moment so

00:00:41.070 00:00:42.830
that's why I'm wiggling ran a little bit

00:00:43.110 00:00:45.799
it's not drastic at this point like it

00:00:46.050 00:00:49.100
tends to get sometimes so I thought I'd

00:00:49.289 00:00:53.840
gets in before it got bad anyway let's

00:00:54.120 00:00:56.569
start with the minute and trial as main

00:00:56.820 00:01:00.110
own previous post and blog as well as

00:01:00.480 00:01:03.920
video blog I signed up to do a minute an

00:01:04.530 00:01:06.710
ER trial extended release version of a

00:01:07.110 00:01:08.960
minimum so I had to get off of him in

00:01:09.119 00:01:12.320
and then that I was gone back in January

00:01:12.479 00:01:14.090
through December excuse me june through

00:01:14.520 00:01:19.940
december and and in the process of that

00:01:20.640 00:01:22.700
seemed like my Parkinson's symptoms got

00:01:22.770 00:01:25.460
worse so that it's are taking twice the

00:01:25.560 00:01:28.429
amount of cinnamon as I was before I

00:01:29.040 00:01:31.100
started a minuted which I've heard can

00:01:31.670 00:01:34.340
happen that's kind of hoping maybe that

00:01:34.530 00:01:37.370
was just a temporary thing that my body

00:01:37.619 00:01:40.310
would would come back from it really

00:01:40.590 00:01:42.590
hasn't happened I'm still having to take

00:01:43.320 00:01:45.190
double the dose sentiment in order to

00:01:46.200 00:01:51.140
maintain some normalcy aside for them

00:01:52.150 00:01:56.100
dyskinesia effect which is probably

00:01:56.350 00:01:59.700
about as bad as it's ever been in regard

00:01:59.950 00:02:02.430
to what happens that's probably the time

00:02:02.680 00:02:07.940
on double doses and just single dose so

00:02:09.330 00:02:12.480
what happened is is that as i was taking

00:02:12.700 00:02:15.420
the initial tests and lab work from the

00:02:15.820 00:02:16.950
trial which had to start out with the

00:02:17.410 00:02:18.840
basic levels they want to see where

00:02:18.970 00:02:20.100
you're at before you started taking a

00:02:21.870 00:02:24.120
vacation it came up that i had a low

00:02:24.459 00:02:26.850
hema excuse me a low platelet count and

00:02:27.850 00:02:29.190
they did another test they wanted to

00:02:29.320 00:02:32.010
make sure that I wasn't there wasn't a

00:02:32.440 00:02:34.620
problem that underlying problem I needed

00:02:34.720 00:02:37.380
to address before i started the trial so

00:02:37.540 00:02:39.630
the start of the trial is delayed as i

00:02:39.880 00:02:42.540
went to a doctor and he did a lot of

00:02:42.820 00:02:44.810
blood tests and determined that it was

00:02:45.820 00:02:48.510
just idiopathic chronic platelet low

00:02:48.940 00:02:50.340
platelet count but it wasn't anything

00:02:51.250 00:02:55.170
critical no leukemia to speak of he says

00:02:55.330 00:02:56.820
the risk for that and very very low

00:02:57.160 00:02:59.810
since there's a there's one type of

00:03:00.930 00:03:04.170
leukemia it's very rare that would

00:03:04.810 00:03:06.390
result in a low platelet count not

00:03:06.700 00:03:08.340
affect white blood cells red blood cell

00:03:08.800 00:03:12.449
accounts starting out so any other kind

00:03:12.580 00:03:15.030
of leukemia it's the majority of them

00:03:15.130 00:03:17.550
would be you would have seen low red

00:03:17.860 00:03:19.259
cell count and low white blood cell

00:03:19.690 00:03:21.270
counts and things like that near

00:03:21.970 00:03:23.940
regularities of the blood but the none

00:03:24.070 00:03:25.350
of that showed up everything else looked

00:03:25.570 00:03:27.410
normal just accept a low platelet count

00:03:28.420 00:03:33.860
so there's all kids is that getting re

00:03:34.870 00:03:39.840
baselines monday for my beginning the

00:03:40.299 00:03:43.080
trial again and then hopefully will soon

00:03:43.480 00:03:46.830
start it and if I'm lucky cross your

00:03:47.250 00:03:51.990
fingers pray I won't get the placebo and

00:03:52.209 00:03:53.970
I'll actually get the medication you

00:03:54.160 00:03:55.470
want to help some I hope

00:03:56.290 00:03:58.589
especially with the dyskinesia so we'll

00:03:58.810 00:04:01.830
see how that goes anyway that's where we

00:04:02.080 00:04:03.960
stand with that and so I'll let you know

00:04:04.390 00:04:08.460
more when the trial starts later on the

00:04:08.620 00:04:10.110
other thing get these things out of the

00:04:10.180 00:04:12.330
way so and talk about what our primarily

00:04:12.700 00:04:15.319
wanted to talk about with his exercise

00:04:16.329 00:04:18.060
disability benefits back in november i

00:04:18.459 00:04:20.699
applied for disability benefits this

00:04:21.010 00:04:23.070
past week I received a letter saying

00:04:23.229 00:04:26.450
that I was approved which I was kind of

00:04:27.460 00:04:28.830
somewhat surprised because I really

00:04:29.020 00:04:31.050
expected from lover remember what

00:04:31.360 00:04:32.460
everybody says to be rejected

00:04:32.590 00:04:35.159
immediately and have to apply two or

00:04:35.350 00:04:37.939
three times to me and that kind of thing

00:04:38.949 00:04:42.360
but it happened it didn't happen that

00:04:42.520 00:04:46.710
way and I got on the first shot which is

00:04:46.930 00:04:48.240
pretty good i've heard about forty

00:04:48.520 00:04:51.029
percent of people do apparently i was

00:04:51.190 00:04:54.420
one of the forty percent and which is

00:04:54.639 00:04:56.430
good because I didn't know what basis i

00:04:56.590 00:05:01.560
would have to to call for another shot

00:05:01.630 00:05:06.150
at it but as it turned out I don't have

00:05:06.250 00:05:09.000
to worry about that now the confusion

00:05:09.190 00:05:16.589
that I had was that I got disability

00:05:17.380 00:05:20.370
confused with ssi and my son actually

00:05:20.680 00:05:24.060
has SSI because of his mental health

00:05:24.550 00:05:26.730
issues and the inability to hold down a

00:05:26.860 00:05:31.400
job because of it and with ssi you get

00:05:32.410 00:05:33.990
medicaid medicaid that comes along with

00:05:35.070 00:05:37.620
that regular disability that's not

00:05:38.200 00:05:39.540
automatic you have to apply for the

00:05:39.669 00:05:44.700
other benefits separately and so i had

00:05:44.979 00:05:47.850
two options it appeared if i wanted to

00:05:48.130 00:05:50.810
get more than just disability payments

00:05:51.820 00:05:53.580
if i wanted some health insurance i've

00:05:53.770 00:05:56.339
actually got to either apply for ssi to

00:05:57.130 00:06:00.089
or directly for medicaid which I'm think

00:06:00.190 00:06:01.650
I'm taking the last latter option

00:06:02.110 00:06:03.300
because i think if i get ssi it's

00:06:03.700 00:06:06.000
basically reduces down one to one

00:06:07.010 00:06:09.220
disability benefits and on those it

00:06:09.440 00:06:11.380
would be that much advantage to me to

00:06:11.540 00:06:15.640
get ssi in addition to disability and so

00:06:16.040 00:06:17.410
I'm looking into just applying to

00:06:17.840 00:06:21.310
Medicaid directly and but even if that

00:06:21.800 00:06:24.340
doesn't pan out what does happen is

00:06:24.820 00:06:29.670
within 24 months of being undisciplined

00:06:32.410 00:06:35.440
now Medicare would kick in which means

00:06:36.020 00:06:39.040
since my disability is officially

00:06:39.680 00:06:40.810
registered as having started at a march

00:06:41.150 00:06:48.310
first of last year the this coming march

00:06:48.710 00:06:51.580
first would be my one-year mark so I'd

00:06:51.620 00:06:53.950
have another year to go without getting

00:06:54.230 00:06:56.740
any health insurance I want to just wait

00:06:56.780 00:07:00.010
on the medicare part of it we kick in in

00:07:00.890 00:07:03.670
another year and just struggle through

00:07:03.890 00:07:06.330
for this coming years with what I can

00:07:07.340 00:07:09.160
downside of that is this is where it

00:07:09.380 00:07:10.480
starts getting a little bit complicated

00:07:11.770 00:07:14.860
is there with a disability payments that

00:07:15.050 00:07:17.140
I'm going to be getting there's a good

00:07:17.540 00:07:19.450
chance it would kick me out of most of

00:07:20.140 00:07:22.420
the patient assistance programs I'm all

00:07:22.460 00:07:23.560
I probably making too much money

00:07:24.470 00:07:25.660
something there's always a catch you

00:07:25.820 00:07:28.060
make too much money don't get the other

00:07:28.580 00:07:30.910
benefits if you struggle financially

00:07:31.490 00:07:32.770
then you get these other benefits to

00:07:32.930 00:07:35.020
help out with these things so kind of a

00:07:35.450 00:07:38.710
catch-22 in a sense which means I would

00:07:38.870 00:07:40.690
need to get some kind of health

00:07:41.240 00:07:44.280
insurance for me at least for a year if

00:07:45.290 00:07:48.340
I want to cover those things the other

00:07:48.710 00:07:52.060
thing would simply be to save that money

00:07:55.370 00:07:57.689
and pay through through the nose for

00:07:58.779 00:08:00.700
whatever doctor visits i gettin is

00:08:01.039 00:08:05.200
coming here in waiting for medicare but

00:08:05.990 00:08:07.179
i'm going to see if i can apply for

00:08:07.819 00:08:10.360
medicaid which might cover me through

00:08:10.460 00:08:15.429
the next year and so we're fading our

00:08:15.889 00:08:19.540
options at this point and one of the

00:08:19.610 00:08:21.809
things we're looking into 2 is the

00:08:22.819 00:08:25.899
shared costs group things that are out

00:08:26.139 00:08:28.779
there mostly for Christians which I'm

00:08:28.969 00:08:30.670
one so that puts me in the running for

00:08:30.979 00:08:33.939
it and the only thing so far seems like

00:08:34.399 00:08:36.430
most of those don't cover maintenance

00:08:37.360 00:08:40.689
typed care which predominate art of

00:08:41.539 00:08:43.120
Parkinson's is maintenance not type care

00:08:43.339 00:08:45.579
if I'm reading their information

00:08:46.209 00:08:48.730
correctly there's not a lot of incidents

00:08:48.949 00:08:51.030
in Parkinson's it's just a gradual

00:08:52.040 00:08:54.220
increase in symptoms I'm taking

00:08:55.100 00:08:55.870
medications to try to combat those

00:08:57.490 00:09:00.250
symptoms so I don't know about that

00:09:01.160 00:09:02.079
which leads to the deep brain

00:09:02.720 00:09:04.750
stimulation and trying to see if I get

00:09:04.880 00:09:09.340
on Medicare or Medicaid I think that

00:09:09.500 00:09:14.490
would be covered under their thing so

00:09:15.500 00:09:17.019
still in waiting to try to figure that

00:09:17.089 00:09:22.120
part out now sentiment timing when I was

00:09:22.670 00:09:25.300
taking cinnamon and I increase my dosage

00:09:26.180 00:09:27.790
this can easy would get bad at certain

00:09:28.250 00:09:31.509
points usually what I can figure out the

00:09:31.820 00:09:36.280
timing lately is I take a dose of sin to

00:09:36.620 00:09:40.620
double dose of cinnamon and then it runs

00:09:41.630 00:09:46.200
for a few hours and

00:09:47.210 00:09:55.000
for about 23 hours I'm feeling pretty

00:09:55.610 00:09:59.470
decent tell like now we're even though I

00:09:59.720 00:10:01.770
might have a little bit of dyskinesia

00:10:02.780 00:10:06.790
it's not that noticeable and I can my

00:10:07.250 00:10:13.270
tremors are fairly steady so I can do

00:10:13.580 00:10:14.770
things i can type it a little bit easier

00:10:15.650 00:10:17.710
all those kind of things then

00:10:20.080 00:10:22.450
approximately two to three hours after i

00:10:22.730 00:10:24.910
take that I start getting dyskinesia

00:10:25.700 00:10:26.650
starts getting worse the whole head

00:10:27.020 00:10:28.870
bobbing thing that you saw last time on

00:10:28.910 00:10:30.910
the video and sometimes you can get

00:10:31.100 00:10:32.920
pretty bad and my neck starts getting

00:10:33.230 00:10:35.590
tired and those kind of things sometimes

00:10:35.690 00:10:37.960
I have to lay down sometimes I just push

00:10:38.180 00:10:41.290
through it with whatever I'm doing the

00:10:41.690 00:10:42.730
typing is really hard at that point

00:10:43.480 00:10:45.880
because it seems like the more I try to

00:10:46.220 00:10:48.550
type the worst dyskinesia gets so

00:10:48.980 00:10:49.660
sometimes I have to take a break from

00:10:50.050 00:10:54.660
that but if I'm working with other

00:10:55.670 00:10:57.490
things and physical labor sometimes it

00:10:57.770 00:11:01.420
makes it harder to do but it some

00:11:02.030 00:11:03.610
usually I can push through I may not go

00:11:03.740 00:11:05.980
as fast as I want to know with it anyway

00:11:06.770 00:11:07.930
that's what's happening so I was trying

00:11:08.000 00:11:09.670
to now that I'm on the double dose of

00:11:10.160 00:11:12.310
cinnamon I was going to try to see if

00:11:13.250 00:11:15.820
the timing sinemet three hours of part

00:11:16.040 00:11:18.910
one pill instead of two pills for five

00:11:19.070 00:11:22.470
to six hours would help with dyskinesia

00:11:23.560 00:11:25.600
lowering keeping the sinemet level in my

00:11:25.790 00:11:27.640
body steadier level rather than going to

00:11:27.830 00:11:32.620
big Pete drop and as it seems the result

00:11:33.380 00:11:35.170
it didn't seem to help a lot I mean I

00:11:35.330 00:11:37.090
think maybe the dyskinesia out a little

00:11:37.400 00:11:39.400
bit better but it seemed like the more

00:11:39.650 00:11:42.700
does kind of overlap a dyskinesia and so

00:11:42.770 00:11:44.840
it seemed like I had more dyskinesia for

00:11:45.120 00:11:48.579
longer periods of time on that

00:11:49.589 00:11:51.800
consequently that didn't seem to help

00:11:51.959 00:11:55.420
the tremors as well taking it that way

00:11:56.430 00:11:59.120
so I had less on time where I was

00:12:00.350 00:12:05.269
feeling normal and so I after about a

00:12:05.399 00:12:08.749
week of doing that test I decided to do

00:12:09.720 00:12:11.900
yeah this isn't going to work and I'll

00:12:12.089 00:12:13.759
just go back to taking two pills in a

00:12:14.009 00:12:17.480
time at least there's a window of good

00:12:17.850 00:12:20.660
window of time each five to six hours

00:12:21.540 00:12:26.930
take the dose wear semi normal that

00:12:26.970 00:12:28.970
people want to consider be normal at all

00:12:29.940 00:12:31.519
which there would be some debate about

00:12:32.569 00:12:35.300
that anyway that's where I found out

00:12:35.550 00:12:37.790
that I'm landing back on taking two

00:12:38.480 00:12:41.569
pills two pills in a shot and dealing

00:12:41.699 00:12:43.699
with the dyskinesia that comes in and

00:12:44.339 00:12:46.370
hopefully when I start on the minute in

00:12:46.740 00:12:50.389
trial was coming few weeks I'll get the

00:12:50.639 00:12:52.460
real thing and hopefully it will

00:12:52.740 00:12:57.230
actually help we'll see so that's where

00:12:57.300 00:12:58.460
you stand with that now what I really

00:12:58.620 00:13:04.040
want to talk about and this coming is

00:13:04.439 00:13:06.290
about this time last year that I signed

00:13:06.540 00:13:09.379
up for classes at my local Y or I signed

00:13:09.569 00:13:11.920
up to be a member of the local wine and

00:13:12.930 00:13:16.329
started doing classes exercise classes

00:13:17.339 00:13:19.160
because i had read and as i mentioned

00:13:19.949 00:13:22.490
law before the cardio exercise

00:13:22.980 00:13:26.319
particularly is very good firm for

00:13:27.329 00:13:29.509
cognitive support and actually as

00:13:30.209 00:13:32.629
studies have shown that it's slow down

00:13:32.759 00:13:34.340
the progression of Parkinson's in the

00:13:35.060 00:13:36.879
brain which is where of course

00:13:37.889 00:13:39.470
Parkinson's originates killing off brain

00:13:39.980 00:13:44.780
cells so I wanted to predominantly get

00:13:45.000 00:13:47.210
into cardio and I found out as I

00:13:47.639 00:13:49.460
mentioned before that one of the best

00:13:49.829 00:13:53.179
types of cardio is cardio that has

00:13:53.550 00:13:56.929
varied movements AKA dancing because

00:13:57.480 00:13:59.900
then you're not just doing a repetitive

00:14:00.510 00:14:02.150
movement any kind of cardio is going to

00:14:02.250 00:14:06.139
be helpful for brain stuff but there are

00:14:07.050 00:14:09.530
varied movements involves your brain

00:14:10.260 00:14:13.160
function more in coordinating balance

00:14:13.980 00:14:15.710
and things of that nature which is also

00:14:15.990 00:14:18.019
really critical for parkinson's so it's

00:14:18.180 00:14:21.500
just a more overall beneficial type of

00:14:21.870 00:14:24.230
cardio exercise to do that and so

00:14:24.870 00:14:26.990
consequently i did something is I never

00:14:27.480 00:14:29.660
done before which was decided to do some

00:14:29.880 00:14:32.750
kind of dancing never been an answer in

00:14:32.910 00:14:36.040
my life and usually shot away from it

00:14:37.050 00:14:39.470
but of course this isn't Dancing to

00:14:39.720 00:14:42.160
dance this is dancing to save my brain

00:14:43.170 00:14:45.620
so I figured this was a good motivation

00:14:45.959 00:14:48.860
to do it and consequently i started out

00:14:49.380 00:14:53.569
zumba classes in the Y back at the end

00:14:53.670 00:14:55.400
of last februari or beginning of march i

00:14:55.649 00:14:57.549
can't remember exactly when it was and

00:14:58.559 00:15:01.549
the result was that i've been doing on

00:15:02.550 00:15:05.090
average three to four classes of zumba a

00:15:05.420 00:15:09.079
week since then pretty faithfully as the

00:15:09.449 00:15:14.770
people there can testify and

00:15:15.780 00:15:17.690
also added on that Pilates which helps

00:15:17.820 00:15:21.790
on a core strengthening and I also in

00:15:22.800 00:15:25.190
october i think it was beginning of

00:15:26.000 00:15:29.570
november started adding on body step and

00:15:30.090 00:15:33.290
body pump body pump has really helped

00:15:33.660 00:15:35.570
since then with strengthening my muscles

00:15:35.820 00:15:38.090
which have been growing week so i'll

00:15:38.400 00:15:40.250
mention a little bit about that but i

00:15:40.410 00:15:45.170
want to talk about in as my past year or

00:15:45.630 00:15:47.930
doing all these exercises what benefits

00:15:48.120 00:15:53.690
have noticed which early have been some

00:15:53.910 00:15:56.420
real benefits that have shown up due to

00:15:57.380 00:16:03.140
that one is just my energy level has

00:16:04.040 00:16:06.950
improved as a matter of fact last time a

00:16:07.440 00:16:09.530
couple of times people have taken my

00:16:10.200 00:16:13.580
pulse the doctor's office they asked me

00:16:14.490 00:16:18.590
is your pulse always this slow at 58

00:16:19.590 00:16:23.390
beats per minute and I say well yeah

00:16:23.670 00:16:24.830
lately it has been because I've been

00:16:25.050 00:16:28.100
doing a lot of exercise and so my heart

00:16:28.860 00:16:30.050
apparently is in good shape and healthy

00:16:32.240 00:16:36.850
and being very efficient at this point

00:16:37.860 00:16:42.950
so notice that benefit and one of the

00:16:43.020 00:16:45.640
things that I noticed there's a benefit

00:16:46.650 00:16:49.310
was is probably mentioned before my blog

00:16:49.790 00:16:54.830
is that there's a lot of issues with

00:16:55.620 00:16:59.020
bamboo not excuse me bladder control

00:17:00.030 00:17:02.300
with park than somewhat battle control

00:17:02.760 00:17:05.870
as well as mixed in there and I was

00:17:06.089 00:17:10.160
having some of those problems back in

00:17:10.709 00:17:16.250
November a 2014 when I went on a trip to

00:17:16.860 00:17:17.910
Mississippi to visit of mine

00:17:18.210 00:17:23.690
daughter and son-in-law and grandkids I

00:17:24.700 00:17:26.490
was having to do frequent stops on the

00:17:26.920 00:17:29.880
chicken or a trip and sometimes I was in

00:17:30.070 00:17:32.190
very desperate state to get to places

00:17:32.950 00:17:34.500
sometimes it was a little bit where I

00:17:34.780 00:17:39.420
didn't quite make it in time and I never

00:17:39.790 00:17:42.020
had that drastic of a problem with

00:17:43.030 00:17:47.490
bladder control but really parks in

00:17:47.980 00:17:49.950
affected me knowing now this last

00:17:50.620 00:17:51.960
November when we went on the same trip

00:17:52.590 00:17:57.060
to Mississippi I was quite normal I

00:17:57.940 00:18:00.930
didn't have any issues I could hold hold

00:18:01.120 00:18:02.850
it well until he came to the next stop I

00:18:03.420 00:18:06.180
wasn't constantly feeling like I needed

00:18:06.370 00:18:10.470
to go pee after heavy home Gump in for

00:18:10.690 00:18:13.260
another an hour ago or so so I was able

00:18:13.450 00:18:15.630
to wait until we stopped in normal time

00:18:16.180 00:18:17.970
all that good stuff and that's when I

00:18:18.450 00:18:21.930
realized hey my bladder control has

00:18:22.180 00:18:23.900
gotten a lot better this past you and

00:18:24.910 00:18:26.250
first I didn't know wine that it

00:18:26.590 00:18:28.110
happened I figured what did I taking it

00:18:28.600 00:18:31.290
cause that and then it is dawned on me a

00:18:31.800 00:18:35.700
few weeks ago bladder control problems

00:18:36.370 00:18:39.780
as well as val control problems or

00:18:40.360 00:18:41.640
predominantly due to the fact that

00:18:42.160 00:18:44.310
muscles in those regions start we can do

00:18:44.440 00:18:47.160
to Parkinson's and so you're not able to

00:18:47.710 00:18:48.990
control it with your muscles as well

00:18:49.800 00:18:53.280
who's used to me and especially doing

00:18:53.380 00:18:55.250
the Pilates which is a course drinking

00:18:56.260 00:19:00.270
series of exercises that is actually

00:19:01.150 00:19:03.870
improved my bladder control so that's

00:19:04.540 00:19:08.160
one definite thing now still have few

00:19:08.470 00:19:10.050
issues here and there with that was

00:19:10.930 00:19:13.680
nothing like it was before and saw

00:19:14.590 00:19:17.570
feeling quite normal

00:19:17.700 00:19:19.970
and one of the other big factors I've

00:19:20.400 00:19:22.780
noticed is when since i started doing

00:19:23.790 00:19:28.310
body pump and there's other exercises

00:19:28.800 00:19:31.460
that I do other classes that coordinate

00:19:31.620 00:19:34.420
with us but body pump is basically

00:19:35.430 00:19:38.300
lifting weights a lot for an hour and

00:19:38.610 00:19:40.220
tiring out your muscles a lot of squats

00:19:40.560 00:19:43.280
with links on your back lunges with the

00:19:43.470 00:19:45.500
weights on your back hello I don't tend

00:19:45.630 00:19:47.540
to do the lunges with the weights on

00:19:47.910 00:19:51.050
very often just because my legs are not

00:19:51.240 00:19:55.180
at that level yet and several other

00:19:56.190 00:19:57.830
types of exercise of the biceps and

00:19:58.020 00:20:01.250
triceps and all the sets you can think

00:20:01.470 00:20:04.160
it probably and it tries to cover all

00:20:04.440 00:20:06.800
the major muscle group beings and

00:20:07.140 00:20:08.990
lifting weights anyway I've been doing

00:20:09.120 00:20:12.410
that since november and i can tell my

00:20:13.080 00:20:16.220
strengthen has really improved matter of

00:20:16.380 00:20:18.140
fact with thing i noticed that most on

00:20:18.710 00:20:21.260
moves when I swam underwater in the

00:20:22.140 00:20:25.520
swimming pool before I noticed that I

00:20:25.920 00:20:27.920
didn't have the ability to state lender

00:20:28.110 00:20:30.980
as well and I couldn't move as fast as I

00:20:31.020 00:20:34.490
used to be able to move and seem like I

00:20:34.770 00:20:35.780
tended to float up back up to the top

00:20:38.180 00:20:40.790
and since I've been doing body pump that

00:20:40.980 00:20:43.820
is all come back I'm now able to zoom

00:20:44.340 00:20:46.990
for long periods of time underwater and

00:20:48.000 00:20:50.810
go quickly and so I can tell my strength

00:20:50.910 00:20:54.260
to come back to my legs and my arms so

00:20:54.450 00:20:58.700
do that and that's improved other

00:20:59.430 00:21:00.950
aspects of Parkinson's because

00:21:01.740 00:21:03.790
bradykinesia which is the slowing down

00:21:04.800 00:21:06.860
aspect and the smaller steps things like

00:21:06.900 00:21:09.740
that there's a lot due to the quick

00:21:10.680 00:21:12.159
degeneration of your muscles and your

00:21:12.619 00:21:14.200
you know our bodies not keeping up with

00:21:15.049 00:21:17.529
adjusting to that so your steps become

00:21:17.950 00:21:21.369
smaller you start slowing down like when

00:21:21.409 00:21:23.560
I do help will need on occasion with

00:21:23.989 00:21:26.680
cleaning your house I was going slow

00:21:27.320 00:21:29.320
before and I felt like I was going at a

00:21:29.570 00:21:32.379
normal pace but reality was is that I

00:21:33.289 00:21:37.239
was slow and not even when I pushed it

00:21:37.970 00:21:39.369
seemed like I wasn't going quite as fast

00:21:39.739 00:21:46.090
as what i thought i was going and since

00:21:46.369 00:21:48.430
the string thing with the thing I've

00:21:48.590 00:21:49.749
been able to pick up the pace quite a

00:21:49.999 00:21:55.529
bit and I'm almost back semi-normal in

00:21:56.539 00:22:00.460
witness and steps and stuff in fact the

00:22:00.799 00:22:02.999
doctor last time I was at the office

00:22:04.009 00:22:05.739
noticed that my left arm when I walked

00:22:06.289 00:22:08.529
was swing which my left arm is my rigid

00:22:08.840 00:22:13.479
arm and tends to just a lot of patience

00:22:14.210 00:22:16.599
virginity tends to force it not to swing

00:22:16.909 00:22:18.609
when you're walking so you have an

00:22:18.889 00:22:22.869
abnormal gait and he was surprised of

00:22:22.909 00:22:23.950
course think some of that was kind of

00:22:24.350 00:22:25.359
medication was all the time he was

00:22:25.820 00:22:29.680
testing me but I was the poem then you

00:22:29.840 00:22:30.789
know there's probably new doll i'm

00:22:31.220 00:22:33.700
working on it did and strengthening the

00:22:33.830 00:22:37.840
muscles and so it helps reduce slowness

00:22:38.779 00:22:42.219
the gates improved

00:22:43.229 00:22:47.979
several other factors in that nature so

00:22:48.989 00:22:51.829
strengthening aspect counteracting the

00:22:52.769 00:22:54.829
muscle degeneration of Parkinson's has

00:22:55.109 00:22:57.889
been quite helpful in several aspects of

00:22:58.440 00:22:59.810
symptoms that i was developing that

00:23:00.269 00:23:02.810
reversed at this point so I mean that's

00:23:03.149 00:23:04.879
the nice thing is actually on something

00:23:04.950 00:23:07.399
it actually reversed symptoms and

00:23:08.039 00:23:10.430
Parkinson's now eventually I'll lose out

00:23:10.950 00:23:13.249
soon it'll get cured the tier doesn't

00:23:13.409 00:23:17.329
come about who knows what other aspects

00:23:17.519 00:23:24.009
might come about but for now so and

00:23:25.019 00:23:27.019
currently I really started picking up on

00:23:27.570 00:23:28.849
doing a little pickle ball on the side

00:23:29.450 00:23:31.129
tune which you don't know what that is

00:23:31.820 00:23:34.940
it's look it up on Google it's kind of a

00:23:35.429 00:23:39.199
combination of badminton ping-pong and

00:23:41.089 00:23:43.759
tennis if I won't go into that now you

00:23:43.919 00:23:46.190
can look up find out more about it but

00:23:46.379 00:23:50.289
it involves my lot of tennis light

00:23:51.769 00:23:54.739
activity so I'm just keeping a lot of

00:23:55.200 00:23:56.239
exercise doing about nine hours

00:23:56.909 00:24:01.009
altogether on average every week and I

00:24:01.320 00:24:03.409
guess I'm thankful and I don't have a

00:24:03.479 00:24:05.299
job in that respect that means i can

00:24:05.519 00:24:06.499
devote the time to doing all this

00:24:07.049 00:24:08.419
exercise which if i was working

00:24:08.789 00:24:10.219
full-time job on the wife is i probably

00:24:10.619 00:24:17.269
couldn't do as much so that has been

00:24:17.579 00:24:19.310
helpful and i thought i'd update you let

00:24:19.440 00:24:19.750
you know

00:24:20.420 00:24:24.820
that situation so I'm surviving and not

00:24:25.130 00:24:28.590
doing too bad the only down times i have

00:24:29.600 00:24:31.960
dyskinesia gets bad sometimes it's worse

00:24:32.180 00:24:34.510
than other times too not always horrible

00:24:35.450 00:24:38.850
and sometimes it gets pretty bad we're

00:24:39.860 00:24:43.120
pretty much need to sit down and rest

00:24:43.310 00:24:46.810
for a bit but that's life at this point

00:24:47.120 00:24:48.400
so anyway this has gone on long enough

00:24:49.070 00:24:50.470
it's longer than i usually go for one of

00:24:50.600 00:24:51.820
these two they wanted but i had a lot of

00:24:52.100 00:24:54.340
stuff to cover and hopefully it's been

00:24:54.890 00:24:55.930
somewhat interesting if you are

00:24:56.270 00:24:59.110
interested in my daily life and what's

00:24:59.480 00:25:01.660

00:25:01.730 00:25:05.620

00:25:05.840 00:25:09.640
stuff going on and i'll ave you next

00:25:09.880 00:25:12.790
