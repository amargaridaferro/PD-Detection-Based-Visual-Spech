00:00:00.989 00:00:02.929
hi my name is Charlotte and I'm going to

00:00:03.090 00:00:04.760
talk to you today about the differences

00:00:05.210 00:00:08.930
between THC and CBD and using CBD for

00:00:09.830 00:00:12.919
benefit reasons as far as medical such

00:00:13.139 00:00:16.730
as Parkinson's disease tremor anxiety

00:00:17.510 00:00:19.279
depression neurodegenerative diseases I

00:00:19.770 00:00:21.650
get questions a lot about whether or not

00:00:21.930 00:00:24.050
you can just smoke pot and if you find

00:00:24.420 00:00:25.970
something that has too high CBD in it

00:00:26.310 00:00:27.320
something like Charlotte's Web or

00:00:27.869 00:00:29.480
harlequin there's a couple other strains

00:00:29.670 00:00:31.400
out there that have been bred to have

00:00:31.679 00:00:34.639
high CBD low THC and a lot of times the

00:00:34.680 00:00:38.299
answer is no THC has been shown to

00:00:38.969 00:00:40.940
heighten your anxiety which when it's

00:00:41.399 00:00:42.799
dealing with neurodegenerative diseases

00:00:43.680 00:00:45.139
specifically tremors essential tremors

00:00:45.270 00:00:47.389
and Parkinson's the anxiety will

00:00:47.940 00:00:50.119
increase your symptoms and a lot of

00:00:50.309 00:00:53.090
times that will increase the tremors

00:00:53.219 00:00:55.069
that you're experiencing because of the

00:00:55.649 00:00:58.490
anxiety so the benefit would be to find

00:00:58.890 00:01:00.680
something that is strictly CBD and not

00:01:01.350 00:01:03.529
THC related the major difference is is

00:01:03.570 00:01:06.530
that the THC is the psychoactive

00:01:07.260 00:01:09.679
chemical in marijuana and also found at

00:01:09.930 00:01:12.710
hemp but the CBD is not psychoactive so

00:01:12.840 00:01:14.660
it doesn't get you high it's the medical

00:01:15.180 00:01:17.179
compound it is what helps deal with the

00:01:17.310 00:01:18.859
anxiety it deals with pain is

00:01:19.580 00:01:20.929
anti-inflammatory it's used for

00:01:21.290 00:01:23.679
arthritis seizures anxiety depression

00:01:25.130 00:01:26.300
PTSD Parkinson's

00:01:26.880 00:01:28.969
the list goes on and on I have customers

00:01:29.040 00:01:33.230
that have used it for acne for psoriasis

00:01:34.079 00:01:37.219
and eczema I mean just hundreds of

00:01:37.350 00:01:39.560
different things but the THC is actually

00:01:39.750 00:01:41.870
not the medical compound when it comes

00:01:42.090 00:01:43.069
to hemp and marijuana

00:01:43.200 00:01:45.859
it is CBD so although you can find

00:01:46.530 00:01:49.550
strains that are high CBD and do allow

00:01:49.950 00:01:50.840
people to be able to smoke pot

00:01:51.750 00:01:54.170
recreationally or medically with the CBD

00:01:54.450 00:01:56.420
and the THC content a lot of times it

00:01:56.579 00:01:57.770
doesn't affect their anxiety when it

00:01:58.020 00:01:59.959
comes to neurodegenerative diseases what

00:02:00.000 00:02:01.999
I have found with my research is that

00:02:02.130 00:02:04.459
the THC oftentimes does not help it

00:02:04.680 00:02:06.499
makes it worse so it is something I want

00:02:06.600 00:02:08.210
to caution you about as far as when

00:02:08.340 00:02:10.790
you're looking into THC versus CBD the

00:02:10.920 00:02:12.470
other thing that's extremely important

00:02:12.569 00:02:13.700
is that if you're not in a

00:02:14.190 00:02:15.860
medical state you need to find something

00:02:16.050 00:02:18.380
that has no THC in it because that's

00:02:18.570 00:02:21.830
going to allow you to grab CBD legally

00:02:22.500 00:02:24.050
in your state and there are a number of

00:02:24.270 00:02:26.750
companies that do that I have found that

00:02:26.850 00:02:29.180
I have customers nationwide as well as

00:02:29.850 00:02:32.150
worldwide that are using CVD because it

00:02:32.250 00:02:35.210
has no THC and it is extracted from hemp

00:02:35.760 00:02:38.480
so it's completely legal with no THC

00:02:39.120 00:02:39.950
president all because they're taking

00:02:40.290 00:02:42.500
just the CBD molecule out and there's

00:02:43.380 00:02:45.950
information about that as well so that's

00:02:46.350 00:02:47.120
something that I feel like it's

00:02:47.820 00:02:49.340
extremely important to know the

00:02:49.770 00:02:51.110
difference and what is actually going to

00:02:51.540 00:02:53.780
benefit you
