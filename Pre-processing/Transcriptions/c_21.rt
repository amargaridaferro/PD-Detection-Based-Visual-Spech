hi welcome back in today's video I will

00:00:04.110 00:00:07.760
be discussing blogging a blog is a video

00:00:08.160 00:00:10.990
blog a blog that contains video content

00:00:12.000 00:00:13.759
blogging involves the same processes

00:00:14.340 00:00:16.090
blogging by sharing information

00:00:17.100 00:00:19.580
experiences and giving advice but it is

00:00:19.830 00:00:21.980
done in video format as opposed to a

00:00:22.380 00:00:24.590
written one if you intend to try

00:00:25.230 00:00:27.880
blogging blogging is a great compliment

00:00:28.890 00:00:31.070
that way you are reaching non-readers as

00:00:31.529 00:00:33.319
well as those following your blog and

00:00:33.719 00:00:37.010
there are both setting up a good blog is

00:00:37.320 00:00:39.260
not very difficult if you have the right

00:00:39.600 00:00:42.139
kind of equipment many bloggers

00:00:42.960 00:00:45.020
including myself set up their blogs on

00:00:45.829 00:00:48.889
YouTube on YouTube you can easily record

00:00:49.289 00:00:52.750
edit and publish video content online

00:00:53.760 00:00:56.569
for my retired whatnow blog I have the

00:00:57.030 00:00:59.139
YouTube channel which hosts this video

00:01:00.149 00:01:02.569
on YouTube you can set up playlists much

00:01:02.850 00:01:05.660
like categories in a blog I have a

00:01:06.060 00:01:07.730
number of playlists on my youtube

00:01:08.210 00:01:10.760
channel that way viewers can find my

00:01:11.250 00:01:13.719
videos grouped according to subject

00:01:14.729 00:01:16.640
YouTube also has a powerful search

00:01:16.680 00:01:19.580
engine much like Google search from my

00:01:20.310 00:01:22.190
experience more of my videos come up on

00:01:22.320 00:01:24.830
the first page of YouTube then my blogs

00:01:25.200 00:01:27.859
do on Google search that means your

00:01:28.229 00:01:30.020
videos may be more easily found on

00:01:30.540 00:01:32.569
YouTube than your written blogs are on

00:01:33.150 00:01:36.080
Google or other search engines one of

00:01:36.180 00:01:37.999
the benefits of blogging is that

00:01:38.549 00:01:39.980
bloggers need not have professional

00:01:40.259 00:01:42.410
writing skills as blogging is more

00:01:42.780 00:01:44.600
inclined towards giving the audience a

00:01:44.909 00:01:47.870
more conversational experience as long

00:01:48.299 00:01:50.660
as the topic or issue being discussed is

00:01:51.329 00:01:53.450
interesting and engaging bloggers and

00:01:53.729 00:01:56.030
the respective blogs can become very

00:01:56.909 00:01:59.840
successful and popular much like a blog

00:02:00.719 00:02:02.090
viewers can leave comments associated

00:02:02.670 00:02:05.179
with your videos and conversation can

00:02:06.380 00:02:09.320
ensue for me creating the video was

00:02:10.909 00:02:12.850
not the technical part but my speaking

00:02:13.129 00:02:15.940
ability I am NOT an actor nor am i a

00:02:16.310 00:02:18.910
very good orator I actually recorded my

00:02:18.950 00:02:21.429
first blog video ten times before I

00:02:21.739 00:02:24.190
thought that was acceptable as I do more

00:02:24.680 00:02:27.399
videos they are getting easier however

00:02:28.099 00:02:30.699
thank God for my video editing program I

00:02:31.129 00:02:32.949
can cut out the bad parts and that

00:02:33.500 00:02:35.199
certainly makes creating the videos a

00:02:35.510 00:02:38.890
lot easier in my next few videos I will

00:02:39.560 00:02:41.979
discuss creating videos the equipment

00:02:42.079 00:02:45.430
and setup I use editing videos the free

00:02:45.709 00:02:48.610
software I use sending up and uploading

00:02:48.980 00:02:51.460
videos to YouTube and how to make money

00:02:51.859 00:02:55.330
