00:00:01.740 00:00:03.980
so if you have the choice between having

00:00:04.370 00:00:11.030
Parkinson's disease or having a fungal

00:00:11.130 00:00:13.220
infection what would you choose one of

00:00:13.469 00:00:18.410
them Parkinson's disease has very broad

00:00:18.840 00:00:20.990
range of possibilities for what causes

00:00:21.449 00:00:23.060
it and so they basically say they don't

00:00:23.279 00:00:26.750
know what causes it and you just go on

00:00:27.199 00:00:29.210
drugs eventually probably don't work too

00:00:29.400 00:00:34.790
well and you can do some stuff with to

00:00:35.130 00:00:36.260
basically help with the symptoms but

00:00:37.050 00:00:42.680
basically your long range prognosis is

00:00:42.899 00:00:47.389
not very good and then this week this

00:00:47.820 00:00:51.020
comes in from a person who wrote a paper

00:00:51.270 00:00:54.410
on the I'll put it down in the links

00:00:54.980 00:00:58.720
below it's pretty exciting news for

00:00:59.730 00:01:01.069
people who have Parkinson's and their

00:01:01.289 00:01:02.750
loved ones and maybe other people who

00:01:02.940 00:01:05.750
have other chronic diseases so basically

00:01:06.000 00:01:08.060
they're saying there's no skin fungus

00:01:08.640 00:01:11.870
and I don't say this name very well it's

00:01:12.380 00:01:15.219
called malassezia it's a fungus that

00:01:16.229 00:01:18.620
they find on the skin and causes like I

00:01:18.840 00:01:22.070
have redness here and I have redness on

00:01:22.380 00:01:24.109
top there in other places on my body I

00:01:24.420 00:01:26.929
get redness before I had the Parkinson's

00:01:27.090 00:01:28.730
and it got really bad around the time my

00:01:29.100 00:01:31.999
Parkinson's got that so you started

00:01:32.189 00:01:35.899
taking a little ink and apparently they

00:01:36.119 00:01:38.300
call it fungal acne and it's common in

00:01:39.180 00:01:41.179
places like the Philippines and other

00:01:41.520 00:01:44.830
places that are hot and wet very

00:01:45.840 00:01:48.590
resistant bacteria but the theory is

00:01:48.659 00:01:50.539
that it can get into the gut and also

00:01:50.729 00:01:54.800
get up into the brain and I think it's

00:01:54.990 00:01:56.539
called ochratoxin there's one of the

00:01:57.049 00:02:00.109
fungus elements that you know I'm not a

00:02:00.930 00:02:02.690
full-on scientist so a lot of this stuff

00:02:02.909 00:02:04.999
is just I'm learning but the ochratoxin

00:02:05.969 00:02:09.169
apparently kills that dopamine receptors

00:02:09.629 00:02:12.920
cells so that might be so basically a

00:02:13.349 00:02:13.970
fungal infection

00:02:14.069 00:02:16.670
and cause the same symptoms of

00:02:17.310 00:02:20.210
Parkinson's disease so I'm excited to

00:02:20.459 00:02:22.729
find out that maybe I might have a

00:02:23.640 00:02:25.089
fungal infection which I can work on

00:02:26.099 00:02:30.440
what diet and maybe some antifungals or

00:02:30.629 00:02:32.570
other things you know my last line of

00:02:32.940 00:02:35.210
the attack would be drugs but what I'm

00:02:35.250 00:02:39.500
doing is um I'm not associated with

00:02:39.629 00:02:42.020
these guys and I got it upside down turn

00:02:42.180 00:02:46.640
it around I'm sending my urine down to

00:02:46.799 00:02:48.559
the states yes and my urine is on the

00:02:48.690 00:02:51.949
way to the states to this lab I went

00:02:52.049 00:02:53.839
around Canada with our great health care

00:02:54.269 00:02:55.699
system and tried to find the labs for

00:02:56.269 00:02:58.699
this but they don't have them in the

00:02:59.010 00:03:02.000
blood tests or labs here in Canada so

00:03:02.190 00:03:04.699
it's going down to the states and they

00:03:04.890 00:03:07.880
will do a panel of all the funguses and

00:03:08.280 00:03:10.759
mold spores and stuff and find out if I

00:03:10.970 00:03:14.270
have elevated levels and they have found

00:03:14.970 00:03:17.750
in people with Parkinson's an increase

00:03:17.970 00:03:21.140
in these levels so it's good news to

00:03:21.299 00:03:25.759
find out about all this so if you live

00:03:25.889 00:03:27.740
in the states it's even easier that you

00:03:28.019 00:03:29.559
got the lab they're called Great Plains

00:03:32.450 00:03:34.430
laboratory there's new types of doctors

00:03:34.680 00:03:36.830
that like in Canada we have a free

00:03:37.139 00:03:38.870
healthcare system but basically you end

00:03:39.030 00:03:43.009
up at a GP and then you end up at a

00:03:43.829 00:03:45.309
specialist if you get a referral to that

00:03:46.319 00:03:48.069
or is in the states they have

00:03:49.079 00:03:51.080
chiropractors and other medical doctors

00:03:51.120 00:03:52.159
and other people

00:03:53.099 00:03:54.440
that practice something called

00:03:55.139 00:03:57.589
functional medicine so that instead of

00:03:57.720 00:04:00.199
just sort of handing you pills in a five

00:04:00.720 00:04:03.050
minute consult they spend time with you

00:04:03.090 00:04:06.080
and they do labs and they look for

00:04:06.299 00:04:08.360
things like molds and law and disease

00:04:08.790 00:04:11.569
and a lot of times they do stem cells

00:04:11.940 00:04:14.420
and stuff but basically they the

00:04:14.940 00:04:16.490
functional medicine doctors as much as I

00:04:18.169 00:04:20.689
understand spend more time trying to

00:04:21.299 00:04:22.850
find the cause of your disease rather

00:04:23.070 00:04:25.129
than giving you sit

00:04:25.409 00:04:27.890
to mask over your symptoms which is

00:04:28.319 00:04:31.520
basically the healthcare system like in

00:04:31.800 00:04:33.499
most free countries you know you get a

00:04:33.810 00:04:36.559
free health care but it's just mainly

00:04:37.560 00:04:39.649
for the symptoms and it's very behind

00:04:39.900 00:04:41.749
the times they they tend on the side of

00:04:42.360 00:04:43.700
safety and protecting themselves so they

00:04:43.889 00:04:47.839
don't try much new stuff so a good thing

00:04:47.999 00:04:49.010
if you're in the States you're getting

00:04:49.229 00:04:52.730
find a functional medicine and if you

00:04:52.979 00:04:55.550
have the disease that like Parkinson's

00:04:55.800 00:04:58.010
or something that's closely related then

00:04:58.289 00:05:02.540
you can throw um maybe mold toxicity as

00:05:02.580 00:05:04.670
a possible cause and especially if you

00:05:04.800 00:05:07.129
get similar to me when you have skin

00:05:07.830 00:05:11.510
breakouts before or after the onset of

00:05:11.699 00:05:15.589
your disease so it's exciting two days

00:05:15.960 00:05:18.019
ago this paper was published on

00:05:18.990 00:05:21.589
malassezia and parkinson's disease also

00:05:22.439 00:05:26.689
relating it to inflammatory bowel

00:05:27.330 00:05:30.019
disease so the same fungus can cause

00:05:30.360 00:05:33.260
that and just as a patient with

00:05:33.479 00:05:37.100
Parkinson's this makes more sense to me

00:05:37.819 00:05:40.579
because my dopamine levels can be really

00:05:40.830 00:05:42.320
good at times like I don't take any

00:05:42.899 00:05:45.339
dopamine drugs so I'm just on natural

00:05:46.349 00:05:48.439
whatever happened but um I noticed that

00:05:48.599 00:05:50.300
there can be such a change from day to

00:05:50.430 00:05:55.850
day or hour to hour my dopamine so for

00:05:56.009 00:05:59.269
me it doesn't really make sense that why

00:05:59.430 00:06:01.909
don't we mean in my brain cells are

00:06:02.250 00:06:03.529
totally burnt out because I just have

00:06:03.839 00:06:05.929
times where I barely function in times

00:06:06.210 00:06:08.809
where I can totally function based on

00:06:09.509 00:06:11.240
things that I do and stuff like that so

00:06:12.210 00:06:14.269
to me it makes more sense that I have a

00:06:14.879 00:06:17.480
fungal infection and when I feed the

00:06:17.939 00:06:21.920
fungus many things like sugar or things

00:06:22.259 00:06:23.659
that make them breed more and they

00:06:24.560 00:06:28.429
proliferate that I am probably get the

00:06:28.949 00:06:32.450
dopamine cells and my guts and you know

00:06:32.550 00:06:34.279
it gets complicated you got the vagus

00:06:34.589 00:06:35.879
nerve you got you know I'm not

00:06:36.159 00:06:37.679
get into all the complicated things now

00:06:38.430 00:06:40.860
it's possible the real them all off but

00:06:41.469 00:06:43.770
what I will do is I'm just making my

00:06:45.330 00:06:48.300
blogs so that people see like if I get

00:06:48.879 00:06:50.550
better which I'm doing like I'm not

00:06:50.860 00:06:52.649
saying I'm gonna totally get better with

00:06:53.289 00:06:54.719
Parkinsons you never know you can have

00:06:55.090 00:06:56.879
really good weeks or days and then you

00:06:57.009 00:07:01.409
can have really bad ones but my theory

00:07:01.479 00:07:03.839
is that anybody can if they're smart

00:07:04.150 00:07:07.290
enough can outsmart a disease and you

00:07:07.449 00:07:10.409
just need the right protocols and I make

00:07:10.569 00:07:12.529
these blogs so other people can see so

00:07:13.539 00:07:15.839
today I will put links down below for

00:07:16.199 00:07:19.830
the malassezia project which is on

00:07:20.289 00:07:21.629
YouTube it's videos called the MELAS

00:07:21.879 00:07:25.040
easy projects which is both the fungus

00:07:26.050 00:07:27.980
they're doing it for Crohn's disease

00:07:29.009 00:07:32.959
Parkinson's and a few other things and

00:07:33.969 00:07:36.570
I'll put links down for these guys where

00:07:36.729 00:07:39.329
you can get tested for mold and I

00:07:39.819 00:07:41.670
encourage you whether you have

00:07:42.339 00:07:44.749
Parkinson's or other things if you have

00:07:45.759 00:07:47.249
fungal skin or acne which is these small

00:07:47.860 00:07:49.260
bumps on your head that look like acne

00:07:50.199 00:07:51.959
but are different and then you got a

00:07:52.419 00:07:54.149
chronic disease after that to maybe look

00:07:54.399 00:07:56.639
down this road and that's why I make

00:07:56.800 00:07:59.129
this video today so there's hope again

00:07:59.560 00:08:02.040
having Parkinson's little hope having a

00:08:02.439 00:08:05.040
fungal infection lots of hope in mind in

00:08:05.289 00:08:07.709
my view so anyhow have a good day take

00:08:07.960 00:08:10.289
care bye bye
