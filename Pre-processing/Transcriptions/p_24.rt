00:00:18.390 00:00:19.970
today I want to talk about shoulder

00:00:20.640 00:00:22.370
surgeries which is something I

00:00:22.650 00:00:23.990
discovered that happened to a lot of

00:00:24.449 00:00:27.769
people besides myself as you know I was

00:00:28.260 00:00:29.779
diagnosed 12 years ago with Parkinson's

00:00:30.170 00:00:32.870
and have been working diligently to put

00:00:33.000 00:00:35.170
together some kind of a formula or a

00:00:36.180 00:00:37.549
program that would help people with

00:00:38.190 00:00:39.979
Parkinson's and the end result we have

00:00:40.680 00:00:43.340
PD on the move calm so many people are

00:00:43.739 00:00:46.670
enjoying it and we've been able to help

00:00:46.980 00:00:51.160
a lot of people and we're very very glad

00:00:52.170 00:00:53.810
because you know Parkinson's is very

00:00:54.480 00:00:57.260
elusive very fickle very strange disease

00:00:57.600 00:00:59.270
it affects everybody differently and

00:01:00.270 00:01:01.700
having lived with it for the last 12

00:01:01.800 00:01:05.509
years I certainly have learned a lot but

00:01:05.760 00:01:07.700
I want to go back to when I was

00:01:08.430 00:01:10.370
diagnosed and tell a little story

00:01:11.369 00:01:14.450
hopefully a short story that I at the

00:01:15.170 00:01:17.960
time concluded that I had a needless

00:01:18.600 00:01:20.719
shoulder surgery and I say needless

00:01:21.299 00:01:23.210
because I was telling my doctors that I

00:01:23.729 00:01:27.380
didn't injure my shoulder and as a as an

00:01:27.780 00:01:29.780
athlete as a dancer I certainly know my

00:01:30.060 00:01:32.420
body better than most people and at the

00:01:32.729 00:01:36.109
time I thought I wish it didn't happen

00:01:36.780 00:01:39.289
but I didn't have a shoulder surgery it

00:01:39.450 00:01:41.780
was a very painful recovery because the

00:01:42.180 00:01:44.359
shoulder was essentially healthy well

00:01:44.640 00:01:46.700
about a year ago and now twelve years

00:01:47.070 00:01:49.969
into Parkinson's my other shoulder my

00:01:50.250 00:01:53.450
left shoulder started to suffer what I

00:01:53.670 00:01:56.810
would call the effects of Parkinson's it

00:01:57.270 00:01:59.359
wasn't that the shoulder wasn't moving

00:01:59.640 00:02:00.380
of frozen

00:02:01.079 00:02:03.289
it was just hurting and hurting quite a

00:02:03.659 00:02:04.789
bit I couldn't sleep

00:02:05.659 00:02:08.600
well for about seven to eight months and

00:02:08.729 00:02:10.880
I didn't want to talk about it on the

00:02:11.340 00:02:11.840
internet or put

00:02:12.060 00:02:14.630
our website only because I wanted to

00:02:14.820 00:02:17.380
make sure that this time I'll find out

00:02:18.390 00:02:21.680
exactly what is going on I was living in

00:02:21.900 00:02:24.080
South Carolina at the time and I went to

00:02:24.410 00:02:28.460
a specialist who had a very different

00:02:28.860 00:02:31.670
approach to how to treat it well he knew

00:02:31.920 00:02:34.310
of course I had Parkinson's and he said

00:02:34.740 00:02:37.160
just work through it which is difficult

00:02:37.530 00:02:39.800
to do when you can't reach up you can't

00:02:40.370 00:02:43.070
reach sideways yeah I couldn't read you

00:02:43.410 00:02:46.100
behind me at all it was extremely

00:02:46.650 00:02:47.330
extremely painful

00:02:47.490 00:02:51.440
I needed help getting dressed so that's

00:02:51.600 00:02:53.930
how bad it was I went to a specialist of

00:02:54.480 00:02:57.050
Moscow who had a similar philosophy that

00:02:57.240 00:03:02.120
I just have to work through it and he

00:03:02.280 00:03:04.760
gave me acupuncture he manipulated my

00:03:05.280 00:03:07.850
shoulder couldn't move much at all but

00:03:08.130 00:03:10.610
oddly enough as I kept working out as

00:03:10.860 00:03:13.790
they kept trying to rehab that shoulder

00:03:14.480 00:03:18.080
myself he did get better and amazingly

00:03:18.240 00:03:20.200
enough it's almost back to normal

00:03:21.210 00:03:24.740
without any surgeries I was prescribed

00:03:24.960 00:03:27.110
all sorts of painkillers in the process

00:03:27.300 00:03:28.610
which I couldn't take because they just

00:03:28.860 00:03:32.120
made me sick so the shoulder situation

00:03:32.310 00:03:36.050
is such that when you are suspecting

00:03:36.300 00:03:38.870
that you may have Parkinson's and you

00:03:39.180 00:03:41.930
have what doctors refer to as the frozen

00:03:42.360 00:03:44.240
shoulder that may not be the whole

00:03:44.580 00:03:48.950
picture because x-rays MRIs might not

00:03:50.090 00:03:53.420
show that there's any kind of a trauma

00:03:53.790 00:03:57.860
or a defect but the doctors at times may

00:03:58.440 00:04:00.800
insist that you get a surgery I would

00:04:01.290 00:04:06.770
advise against it and give it time keep

00:04:08.210 00:04:10.810
exercising work on your diet and

00:04:11.820 00:04:13.460
hopefully your shoulder will recover

00:04:13.800 00:04:15.980
this is what I've learned now after 12

00:04:16.080 00:04:18.229
years of walking and living with

00:04:18.450 00:04:21.180
Parkinson's I can tell you a lot more

00:04:21.370 00:04:23.880
about what goes what goes on in our

00:04:24.370 00:04:26.430
bodies and you can learn a lot of it on

00:04:26.560 00:04:29.640
