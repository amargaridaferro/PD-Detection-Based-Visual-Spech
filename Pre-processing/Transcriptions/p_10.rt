00:00:01.430 00:00:04.530
and on October 31st of 2012 Halloween I

00:00:05.540 00:00:07.599
got a trick instead of a treat until I

00:00:07.910 00:00:10.060
was a I had early onset Parkinson's

00:00:10.910 00:00:13.270
disease being former Marine grew up in

00:00:13.610 00:00:15.579
Oak Cliff rough neighborhood I've

00:00:16.039 00:00:17.740
handled a lot of challenges and I've

00:00:18.289 00:00:20.259
been through you know 9/11 as an

00:00:20.599 00:00:22.779
active-duty military I've lost good

00:00:23.050 00:00:26.080
friends but nothing has hit me as hard

00:00:26.480 00:00:28.300
as that day do you ask yourself why me

00:00:28.939 00:00:30.730
but it's kind of genetics threw the dice

00:00:31.099 00:00:32.640
and I got dealt the snake guys

00:00:33.650 00:00:35.770
Parkinson's is physical but also mental

00:00:36.680 00:00:38.920
kind of disease for the the activities

00:00:39.200 00:00:41.320
that you do without thinking about them

00:00:41.900 00:00:43.420
brushing your teeth in the morning who a

00:00:43.880 00:00:45.610
Parkinson's we have to actually now we

00:00:45.740 00:00:46.630
have to think about it

00:00:46.670 00:00:48.700
I used Michael J Fox as a reference

00:00:48.920 00:00:50.410
seeing what he's been able to do shows

00:00:50.630 00:00:52.810
me that there's a great chance for a

00:00:53.660 00:00:56.880
great life ahead my fiancee Heather

00:00:57.890 00:01:00.220
started to notice a decrease in my

00:01:00.650 00:01:02.800
volume at home in a quiet environment

00:01:03.500 00:01:05.109
and she would constantly have to ask me

00:01:05.420 00:01:07.300
repeat myself Parkinson voice project is

00:01:07.460 00:01:09.910
the only nonprofit organization in the

00:01:10.310 00:01:12.010
United States solely dedicated to

00:01:12.530 00:01:13.870
preserving the voices of those with

00:01:20.420 00:01:22.660
we don't charge patients for therapy our

00:01:23.150 00:01:24.490
program is funded entirely through

00:01:25.100 00:01:26.650
donations and to pay it forward system

00:01:27.080 00:01:28.660
like with any new treatment you have

00:01:28.820 00:01:31.000
your doubts but you know within that

00:01:31.190 00:01:34.120
first we got like alright I've given a

00:01:34.370 00:01:36.130
chance and it's paying off so I'm gonna

00:01:36.680 00:01:39.370
go forward they showed me the entire

00:01:39.770 00:01:42.940
video of before and after and it's like

00:01:43.460 00:01:43.810
night and day

00:01:45.670 00:01:47.980
I could actually understand him and not

00:01:48.200 00:01:50.410

00:01:50.540 00:01:51.880

00:01:51.979 00:01:53.290
to ask somebody over and over again what

00:01:53.360 00:01:55.180
did you say what did you say so it was

00:01:55.430 00:01:56.710
