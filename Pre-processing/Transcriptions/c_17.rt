00:00:01.979 00:00:04.400
hey guys frosty knives here back with

00:00:04.470 00:00:06.499
another book review and today we're

00:00:06.779 00:00:08.509
going to be reviewing the newest story

00:00:08.880 00:00:10.490
by Stephen King we are going to be

00:00:10.860 00:00:13.570
taking a look at Stephen King's

00:00:14.580 00:00:18.410
elevation this is the third offering by

00:00:19.170 00:00:21.920
Stephen King this year ending 2018 with

00:00:22.140 00:00:24.890
this book and just because this says

00:00:25.680 00:00:29.089
elevation a novel I want you to look at

00:00:29.279 00:00:30.650
the length and the size of this book

00:00:30.869 00:00:34.220
this is not a novel this novel clocks in

00:00:34.940 00:00:38.900
at 146 pages it's not really a novella

00:00:39.059 00:00:40.340
it's somewhere between a short story and

00:00:40.559 00:00:42.830
a novella but it's really not a novel it

00:00:42.870 00:00:45.080
is a story that you can read in about an

00:00:45.329 00:00:47.270
hour it's more of a nugget

00:00:48.239 00:00:51.020
it's a nugget of a story so let's get

00:00:51.300 00:00:53.000
into this nugget of a story and find out

00:00:53.190 00:00:54.650
if it's actually worth your time first

00:00:54.809 00:00:56.840
of all what I want to say is that this

00:00:57.120 00:00:59.660
is not a horror story it's not a horror

00:01:00.800 00:01:03.319
story this is more if anything it's a

00:01:03.660 00:01:06.020
social commentary and it's really hard

00:01:06.210 00:01:09.350
to describe so I'm going to read to you

00:01:10.110 00:01:15.530
the description of the story Castle Rock

00:01:15.869 00:01:18.109
is a small town where word gets around

00:01:19.920 00:01:21.950
that's why Scott Carey wants to confide

00:01:22.380 00:01:24.469
only and his friend dr. Bob Ellis about

00:01:24.780 00:01:27.230
his strange condition he's losing weight

00:01:27.840 00:01:30.020
without getting thinner and the scales

00:01:31.020 00:01:32.270
register the same whether he's in his

00:01:32.640 00:01:34.310
clothes or out of them no matter how

00:01:34.590 00:01:37.580
heavy they are Scott also has new

00:01:38.100 00:01:39.560
neighbors who have opened a fine dining

00:01:39.840 00:01:42.200
experience in town although is an

00:01:42.869 00:01:44.560
experience being shunned by the locals

00:01:45.570 00:01:47.210
deidre Macomb and her wife Missy

00:01:47.820 00:01:49.580
Donaldson don't exactly conform to a

00:01:50.189 00:01:51.800
lifestyle the community approves of and

00:01:52.680 00:01:54.920
now scott seems trapped in a feud with

00:01:55.200 00:01:57.050
the couple over their dog's dropping

00:01:57.210 00:01:58.539
their business on his lawn

00:01:59.549 00:02:00.649
Missy may be warm and friendly but

00:02:01.200 00:02:03.260
Deidre is cold as ice as the town

00:02:03.719 00:02:06.080
prepares for its annual Thanksgiving 12k

00:02:06.390 00:02:08.300
run Scott begins to understand the

00:02:09.000 00:02:09.919
prejudices that were been faced and

00:02:10.110 00:02:12.800
tries to help unlikely alliances forum

00:02:12.959 00:02:13.850
and the mystery of Scott's

00:02:14.280 00:02:16.070
fliction brings out the best in people

00:02:16.560 00:02:18.050
who have indulged the worst in

00:02:18.510 00:02:21.860
themselves and others that's the story

00:02:22.140 00:02:24.200
in a nutshell now let's talk a little

00:02:24.420 00:02:26.360
bit about that one of the things I want

00:02:26.460 00:02:29.300
to let you know is that how it says the

00:02:29.790 00:02:32.000
mystery of Scott's affliction we don't

00:02:32.130 00:02:33.500
ever really we don't we don't know

00:02:33.810 00:02:35.510
anything about Scott's affliction and we

00:02:35.790 00:02:37.400
never will know anything about Scott's

00:02:38.010 00:02:39.680
affliction because they don't explain it

00:02:39.900 00:02:40.730
in the book

00:02:43.820 00:02:46.610
so so he's losing weight but he's not

00:02:47.100 00:02:48.590
losing mass which is an interesting

00:02:49.320 00:02:51.890
concept he's getting thinner weight wise

00:02:52.830 00:02:55.040
but physically he's not losing any mass

00:02:55.590 00:02:58.550
so on the scale he may weigh a hundred

00:02:58.680 00:03:00.490
and twenty pounds but he looks like a

00:03:01.500 00:03:03.860
260 pound man it's kind of like thinner

00:03:04.830 00:03:06.320
except that he's not actually getting

00:03:06.600 00:03:09.740
thinner he's just losing weight it's

00:03:10.200 00:03:12.650
almost as if gravity is losing its hold

00:03:12.930 00:03:13.370
on him

00:03:15.110 00:03:18.170
therefore elevation it's an interesting

00:03:19.049 00:03:21.289
concept but it's nothing that we ever

00:03:21.989 00:03:24.920
get explained we don't explain why it's

00:03:25.440 00:03:27.680
happening we don't explain how it

00:03:28.170 00:03:29.539
started and there really is no

00:03:30.470 00:03:33.380
resolution because he decides to not

00:03:33.570 00:03:35.240
talk about it he doesn't want to talk

00:03:35.400 00:03:36.860
about it even though he's losing weight

00:03:37.470 00:03:39.410
he's happy he's happy with the way his

00:03:39.570 00:03:41.479
life is going it's making him euphoric

00:03:41.880 00:03:45.020
and he just doesn't care that's that's

00:03:45.450 00:03:47.720
that part of it the other part of it is

00:03:48.120 00:03:52.400
the fact that he has married to two

00:03:52.590 00:03:54.890
women married as neighbors and how

00:03:55.620 00:03:57.770
Castlerock doesn't accept them and how

00:03:58.680 00:04:01.940
Castlerock is willing to accept lesbians

00:04:02.370 00:04:03.650
in town they're just not willing to

00:04:03.870 00:04:10.130
accept married lesbians so there's that

00:04:10.680 00:04:12.910
struggle and then eventually through the

00:04:13.920 00:04:16.390
hundred and forty six pages

00:04:17.400 00:04:19.940
he eventually manages to befriend them

00:04:20.419 00:04:24.380
and he eventually manages by by winning

00:04:24.660 00:04:27.290
the the turkey trot and by helping

00:04:27.720 00:04:29.869
deidre who is in the Turkey Trot crossed

00:04:30.060 00:04:32.300
the finish line because she she fell and

00:04:32.430 00:04:35.930
he helps her cross he has somehow made

00:04:36.599 00:04:38.300
the town more accepting of them and

00:04:38.460 00:04:41.210
that's that's pretty much how it ends so

00:04:41.370 00:04:43.790
this is not a horror story it's social

00:04:44.340 00:04:49.279
commentary and I'm not really sure how I

00:04:49.470 00:04:51.469
should feel about it

00:04:52.379 00:04:53.899
technically speaking the book is

00:04:55.039 00:04:58.689
well-written the the the characters

00:04:59.699 00:05:01.520
aren't anything to write home about I

00:05:01.590 00:05:03.619
know Stephen King is really good at

00:05:04.530 00:05:06.050
characterization but the characters in

00:05:06.180 00:05:09.490
this book all four or five of them felt

00:05:10.500 00:05:13.070
kind of flat felt a little bit lifeless

00:05:14.069 00:05:18.260
fealty to use a analogy thin just like

00:05:18.569 00:05:20.779
the book they felt thin didn't feel like

00:05:20.940 00:05:22.339
there was a lot here they felt a bit

00:05:23.539 00:05:28.029
shallow and I really don't know how to

00:05:29.039 00:05:31.129
to like how to describe this book of

00:05:31.289 00:05:34.149
whether I liked it or not I mean I

00:05:35.159 00:05:37.610
really supposed to I know I have said in

00:05:37.650 00:05:38.959
previous reviews that I don't always

00:05:39.210 00:05:41.719
need things explained sometimes you do

00:05:42.630 00:05:47.330
are we supposed to believe that this man

00:05:47.669 00:05:51.589
is rapidly losing weight at the at about

00:05:51.840 00:05:54.200
two or three pounds a day but he doesn't

00:05:54.330 00:05:55.550
want to deal with it and he doesn't

00:05:55.860 00:05:57.469
really want to talk about he didn't want

00:05:57.509 00:05:59.510
to find out why he just wants to live

00:05:59.729 00:06:03.920
his euphoric rapidly weight losing life

00:06:04.889 00:06:08.240
until the end are we supposed to believe

00:06:09.169 00:06:13.999
that this single man in a hat in a 12 K

00:06:14.569 00:06:19.369
race simply because he picks up picks up

00:06:19.560 00:06:23.269
a woman who fell that that is enough to

00:06:24.319 00:06:26.930
somehow make the town overcome its

00:06:28.819 00:06:31.430
homophobia there's a lot here that it's

00:06:31.800 00:06:33.920
sort of it's it's almost like a fairy

00:06:34.199 00:06:36.740
tale it's almost like it's too good to

00:06:36.930 00:06:39.050
be true it's almost like things aren't

00:06:39.360 00:06:39.879
this II

00:06:40.009 00:06:41.739
see in the world so Stephen King sought

00:06:41.840 00:06:44.379
have crafted us this sort of fairytale

00:06:44.930 00:06:48.369
as to how he hopes things might be how

00:06:48.439 00:06:51.339
he hopes society might be how he hopes

00:06:51.889 00:06:53.649
things might turn out but we know

00:06:54.620 00:06:55.779
realistically that things don't turn out

00:06:56.449 00:06:58.629
the way they turned out in this book are

00:06:58.699 00:07:00.969
we just supposed to believe that this

00:07:01.779 00:07:04.179
man spends the the last couple of months

00:07:04.610 00:07:08.409
that he has in the world rapidly losing

00:07:09.550 00:07:12.100
weight he goes on a race he helps

00:07:12.529 00:07:13.959
befriend a couple of neighbors and

00:07:14.449 00:07:17.230
that's you know enough to change a town

00:07:17.990 00:07:20.230
attitude and then we get to the end

00:07:20.599 00:07:24.719
where he literally literally floats away

00:07:25.729 00:07:28.059
into the air this is how the book ends

00:07:28.729 00:07:31.809
where he literally has no more weight

00:07:32.529 00:07:37.329
and he literally floats away into the

00:07:37.639 00:07:40.989
sky like a hot-air balloon this is a lot

00:07:41.210 00:07:46.390
to digest even for King King expects us

00:07:46.430 00:07:48.999
to believe a lot in his books and most

00:07:49.219 00:07:51.879
of the time 99% of the time his books

00:07:52.069 00:07:54.040
are well written and his explanations

00:07:54.259 00:07:56.050
are well written all of his books

00:07:56.479 00:07:57.909
whether you like the explanation or not

00:07:58.580 00:08:01.990
have an explanation from Kerry to

00:08:02.330 00:08:03.610
Salem's Lot to the stand all the way up

00:08:04.370 00:08:06.129
he explains why things are the way they

00:08:06.349 00:08:08.079
are whether or not we agree with that

00:08:08.779 00:08:10.659
explanation and he's always done that

00:08:11.180 00:08:13.510
but we literally have a story about a

00:08:13.639 00:08:16.769
man who is rapidly losing weight and

00:08:17.779 00:08:20.379
then simply floats away while his

00:08:20.930 00:08:24.490
friends watch as he floats away into the

00:08:24.860 00:08:29.050
stratosphere I don't buy it it feels

00:08:29.300 00:08:31.600
like a fairy tale is it's supposed to be

00:08:31.819 00:08:34.810
I'm assuming a happy-go-lucky story it's

00:08:35.329 00:08:39.250
supposed to be a feel-good maybe a

00:08:39.969 00:08:43.180
feel-good kind of thing where maybe it's

00:08:43.310 00:08:45.009
a metaphor maybe the whole story is a

00:08:45.680 00:08:48.910
metaphor of when you finally let go of

00:08:49.160 00:08:50.730
all of the things in the world that

00:08:50.860 00:08:53.090
weigh you down then you are finally free

00:08:54.100 00:08:55.590
when you have finally let go of

00:08:55.839 00:08:58.440
everything in the world that is holding

00:08:58.570 00:09:01.560
you down only then is that when you're

00:09:02.140 00:09:05.460
free and then you can float away is that

00:09:05.980 00:09:08.550
this the message of the story I don't

00:09:09.029 00:09:11.850
know I don't know and I don't know how

00:09:11.920 00:09:13.860
to feel about it because it's so

00:09:14.170 00:09:17.690
different from what king has ever done

00:09:18.700 00:09:21.420
it's almost like he just ripped out of a

00:09:22.300 00:09:27.590
story in about an hour it's okay

00:09:28.600 00:09:31.230
read it if you want to read it it'll

00:09:31.420 00:09:32.940
take you you lose about an hour of your

00:09:33.120 00:09:34.980
life but that's about all

00:09:35.640 00:09:38.820
um but like I said I really it's just

00:09:39.310 00:09:41.310
one of those stories where you read it

00:09:41.560 00:09:45.990
and you put it down and you go huh well

00:09:46.029 00:09:49.889
that was interesting that happened but

00:09:50.110 00:09:51.360
you really don't know what to make out

00:09:51.430 00:09:56.340
of it and maybe in this climate the

00:09:56.800 00:09:59.180
social political climate that were in

00:10:00.190 00:10:02.389
maybe King wanted to write a story that

00:10:03.399 00:10:05.430
he felt was uplifting maybe King wanted

00:10:05.589 00:10:08.220
to write something with a happy-go-lucky

00:10:09.100 00:10:12.420
ending some type of uplifting tale that

00:10:12.910 00:10:16.519
would make people feel encouraged and

00:10:17.529 00:10:20.430
happy if only for a brief moment in time

00:10:20.829 00:10:24.569
but it just left me confused and left me

00:10:24.760 00:10:28.079
confused and going well that was read

00:10:28.390 00:10:31.769
and that's a choice I think I gave it a

00:10:32.020 00:10:34.740
2 on Goodreads because I really didn't

00:10:34.899 00:10:40.949
know where to stand with it I think it's

00:10:41.260 00:10:45.120
already been optioned for a movie so

00:10:45.370 00:10:49.560
that's gonna be interesting if this

00:10:50.020 00:10:52.110
review sounds confusing it's because the

00:10:52.420 00:10:54.870
story sounds confusing and I really

00:10:55.029 00:11:00.210
don't know how to sort of noodle it

00:11:00.459 00:11:02.460
around in my head I finished this book a

00:11:02.589 00:11:03.870
couple of days ago it's taking me a

00:11:04.180 00:11:04.620
couple of days

00:11:04.690 00:11:06.600
to figure out what I want to do with the

00:11:07.000 00:11:09.110
review did I even want to do a review

00:11:10.120 00:11:13.290
but here we are finishing out 2018 with

00:11:13.570 00:11:16.200
with elevation this could have been a

00:11:16.720 00:11:18.930
kingdom a Kindle short maybe a freebie I

00:11:19.420 00:11:21.000
don't know this book is going for about

00:11:22.590 00:11:25.110
$20 $19.99 is the cover price on this

00:11:25.330 00:11:28.310
thing for a hundred and forty six pages

00:11:29.320 00:11:34.200
so I don't feel as bad about reading

00:11:34.330 00:11:36.870
this story as I did about reading

00:11:37.210 00:11:39.360
Sleeping Beauty's Sleeping Beauty's left

00:11:39.550 00:11:41.490
me kind of confused this left me

00:11:41.650 00:11:45.180
confused as well it's an interesting

00:11:47.100 00:11:49.800
story it's like a fairy tale or social

00:11:51.690 00:11:53.550
commentary it's not one of his better

00:11:53.920 00:11:58.350
books and even the characters felt thin

00:11:58.720 00:12:03.240
and shallow so if you've read this book

00:12:03.760 00:12:07.320
and you liked it leave some comments

00:12:07.390 00:12:09.480
about why you liked it because maybe I'm

00:12:09.700 00:12:11.100
coming at it from a wrong point of view

00:12:11.200 00:12:13.140
I don't know if you read it and you

00:12:13.570 00:12:15.710
liked it you have some thoughts on it

00:12:16.720 00:12:18.180
leave some comments about what you

00:12:18.370 00:12:19.740
thought what you liked what you didn't

00:12:20.530 00:12:21.930
what's your like if you read it and you

00:12:22.150 00:12:24.120
didn't like it you hated it leave some

00:12:24.610 00:12:27.000
comments and tell me what you hated

00:12:27.220 00:12:27.510
about it

00:12:28.150 00:12:30.450
let's have some discussion going because

00:12:30.640 00:12:33.060
I want to see what other people think

00:12:33.130 00:12:35.280
about this book this is so different

00:12:35.770 00:12:37.080
that anything King is ever written

00:12:37.810 00:12:39.420
because it's not horror even the horror

00:12:39.760 00:12:42.090
in it a man rapidly losing weight my god

00:12:42.340 00:12:43.290
the man's euphoric

00:12:43.750 00:12:48.150
he doesn't care you know so it's so

00:12:48.460 00:12:51.930
different than anything else that King

00:12:52.120 00:12:54.420
has done I would like to know people

00:12:54.670 00:12:56.340
stops tell me what you thought about it

00:12:56.710 00:12:58.140
wait did you like it did you hate it did

00:12:58.270 00:12:59.490
you understand it what it was your

00:12:59.880 00:13:03.840
takeaway what did you get out of it let

00:13:03.880 00:13:07.140
me know in the comments so uh yeah I

00:13:07.510 00:13:10.920
gave it a 2 on Goodreads it is what it

00:13:11.460 00:13:15.060
is and that's my review we're not gonna

00:13:15.370 00:13:16.970
have another king book for awhile

00:13:18.970 00:13:20.550
and you know that's a good thing because

00:13:20.800 00:13:22.110
there is such a thing as King burnout

00:13:23.040 00:13:26.400
and especially when you get books that

00:13:26.819 00:13:31.220
are you know the outsider was okay

00:13:32.230 00:13:34.410
flatter fright was just an anthology

00:13:34.779 00:13:38.370
that he helped edit and his story that

00:13:38.649 00:13:41.519
he wrote and it wasn't it wasn't that

00:13:41.769 00:13:44.850
good I don't really want to say that

00:13:45.430 00:13:46.980
Stephen King has run out of gas but this

00:13:47.290 00:13:52.470
makes me wonder so let me know what you

00:13:52.690 00:13:54.240
thought about the book let me know if

00:13:54.370 00:13:55.650
you've read it what you thought

00:13:55.899 00:13:59.699
what's your opinions and as always like

00:14:00.160 00:14:03.059
