00:01:05.100 00:01:06.140
non-physical information from the

00:01:06.690 00:01:08.270
non-physical realms into the physical

00:01:08.430 00:01:10.010
realm so that we can really live our

00:01:10.230 00:01:14.000
best lives so okay so with that I just

00:01:14.160 00:01:16.550
want to say for Parkinson's folks the

00:01:16.800 00:01:19.340
root cause of Parkinson's issues because

00:01:19.440 00:01:21.080
I've worked with a number of people who

00:01:21.240 00:01:22.940
have had Parkinson's and in fact one of

00:01:23.070 00:01:25.220
my clients who had Parkinson's when she

00:01:25.380 00:01:27.440
first came to me she came to me for help

00:01:27.780 00:01:30.830
with her dog and she just wanted to be

00:01:31.050 00:01:32.300
able to walk her dog around the block

00:01:32.550 00:01:35.810
because she couldn't stand up out of her

00:01:36.180 00:01:40.580
chair without falling back over and she

00:01:40.860 00:01:42.710
couldn't stand up or walk without a

00:01:43.020 00:01:45.140
crutch really like a walker and she

00:01:45.330 00:01:46.640
wanted to be able to walk her dog and I

00:01:46.860 00:01:49.610
worked with her for a you know a few

00:01:50.360 00:01:52.730
sessions not even but it wasn't even

00:01:53.010 00:01:54.620
full sessions it was we did a few little

00:01:54.810 00:01:57.650
things and in a very short time she was

00:01:57.870 00:01:59.750
able to not only stand up without a

00:02:00.300 00:02:01.460
walker she was able to get up and down

00:02:01.620 00:02:03.650
the stairs and easily walk her dog

00:02:04.170 00:02:08.089
around the block and after a period of

00:02:08.280 00:02:09.559
time she came back to me she said her

00:02:10.050 00:02:11.600
daughter was graduating from college and

00:02:11.670 00:02:13.759
she wanted third but going to college

00:02:13.950 00:02:15.289
and she wanted to be able to get on a

00:02:15.480 00:02:18.210
plane fly across country and help her

00:02:18.850 00:02:20.730
moving to college so we did some more

00:02:21.190 00:02:23.610
sessions together and for sure but by

00:02:23.680 00:02:25.260
the time her daughter was ready to move

00:02:25.420 00:02:29.370
into college her she was able to get on

00:02:29.410 00:02:33.000
a plane and she was able to walk seven

00:02:33.460 00:02:35.880
blocks without even a walker she was

00:02:36.010 00:02:37.470
able to help her daughter move in and

00:02:37.570 00:02:40.730
out and this kind of energy healing

00:02:41.740 00:02:43.110
really worked well for her dramatically

00:02:43.240 00:02:44.730
and she was finding herself in addition

00:02:44.920 00:02:46.920
to all that other kinds of really

00:02:47.200 00:02:48.900
wonderful ships were happening for her

00:02:49.450 00:02:51.240
one of which was that she was happier

00:02:51.460 00:02:52.920
that she was healthier she felt like she

00:02:53.110 00:02:54.780
didn't really even need her meds anymore

00:02:55.300 00:02:57.150
she started to shift with her doctor's

00:02:57.670 00:02:59.160
assistance to wean off of those as well

00:03:00.210 00:03:03.480
so okay so let's go here with

00:03:04.620 00:03:06.860
Parkinson's understand the root cause of

00:03:07.870 00:03:09.810
Parkinson's is the root cause of every

00:03:10.300 00:03:12.720
illness is not in the physical body the

00:03:12.970 00:03:15.510
root cause is in the mental body that's

00:03:15.730 00:03:17.280
the way we've been thinking thought

00:03:17.770 00:03:20.850
patterns and belief systems etc opinions

00:03:21.670 00:03:25.770
judgments etc linked in with emotional

00:03:26.590 00:03:28.110
reaction to those thoughts and those

00:03:28.450 00:03:30.660
beliefs and those emotional reactions

00:03:31.209 00:03:34.080
store up in the body as blockages and

00:03:34.720 00:03:37.050
density heaviness that blockage and that

00:03:37.570 00:03:38.760
density and that heaviness from the

00:03:39.040 00:03:40.080
belief systems and the belief patterns

00:03:40.480 00:03:43.979
and the emotions form a physical disease

00:03:44.440 00:03:45.660
this is true regardless of whether or

00:03:45.790 00:03:47.759
not you have Parkinson's the key with

00:03:48.400 00:03:50.100
Parkinson's is that these people who

00:03:50.230 00:03:51.720
have Parkinson's have been told through

00:03:52.950 00:03:56.610
generations lifetimes that you know

00:03:56.739 00:03:58.680
they've been overly criticized so the

00:03:58.870 00:04:00.690
root core has to do with being over

00:04:01.330 00:04:02.670
criticized through lifetimes and

00:04:03.310 00:04:04.830
generations and believing and buying

00:04:05.290 00:04:07.290
into that criticism to the point where

00:04:07.510 00:04:09.960
you feel incapable of making a right

00:04:10.180 00:04:11.430
choice a right decision and so you

00:04:11.830 00:04:13.710
stutter Stumbo saying you but whoever it

00:04:13.890 00:04:16.770
is in this kind of immobility I'm

00:04:17.440 00:04:19.800
immobile I can't stand up for myself

00:04:19.930 00:04:21.920
I don't know how to stand up for myself

00:04:22.930 00:04:24.390
I'm overly criticized I don't under

00:04:24.430 00:04:25.219
stand up for myself

00:04:26.229 00:04:28.800
so that's root cause stuff that's what

00:04:28.990 00:04:30.270
needs to be cleared heal then resolved

00:04:30.430 00:04:31.320
that's why you

00:04:31.449 00:04:33.600
the physical reality Parkinson's cannot

00:04:33.789 00:04:35.850
be healed from a physical perspective

00:04:36.400 00:04:38.909
unless you address these belief systems

00:04:39.129 00:04:41.879
and these emotions so I'm pointing them

00:04:42.039 00:04:43.679
out here because whoever you work with

00:04:44.020 00:04:45.059
whatever you do if you're willing to

00:04:45.400 00:04:47.249
heal and address and resolve that to

00:04:47.560 00:04:49.890
really really take take on the higher

00:04:50.319 00:04:52.050
truth that you can stand up for yourself

00:04:52.659 00:04:55.080
that it is safe for you to speak up to

00:04:55.330 00:04:56.820
speak authentically to speak your truth

00:04:57.009 00:04:59.189
it is safe for you and you have the

00:04:59.409 00:05:01.260
right not in an aggressive way just to

00:05:01.539 00:05:03.420
speak your truth honestly authentically

00:05:03.639 00:05:05.969
with Hartington I'm just being true to

00:05:06.400 00:05:08.670
you you have the right it is safe for

00:05:09.099 00:05:12.959
you you can choose it and you have the

00:05:13.090 00:05:14.760
ability within you to stand up for

00:05:14.949 00:05:17.399
yourself and to cast off the criticism

00:05:18.219 00:05:20.399
to refuse to allow the inner voice of

00:05:20.590 00:05:23.040
the critic to tell this critic I'm

00:05:23.379 00:05:24.930
firing you I fired the voice of the

00:05:25.240 00:05:27.390
critic and transform every inner voice

00:05:27.759 00:05:29.939
in your mind as well as the way you feel

00:05:30.310 00:05:33.869
about yourself and others to be a voice

00:05:34.270 00:05:37.080
and a choice to feel kindness to feel

00:05:37.690 00:05:39.540
forgiveness to feel safety to feels

00:05:40.000 00:05:42.719
trust within yourself to know that it's

00:05:43.029 00:05:44.700
okay for you to stand up for yourself to

00:05:44.949 00:05:47.369
speak up for yourself and to tell the

00:05:47.740 00:05:49.409
critics in your life within your own

00:05:49.589 00:05:51.719
mind it's time for them to go they're

00:05:52.379 00:05:54.480
fired alright there's more to it but

00:05:54.669 00:05:56.640
that is really root core issue for

00:05:57.159 00:05:59.369
Parkinson's on a physical level this has

00:05:59.620 00:06:02.309
to be said on a physical level

00:06:03.129 00:06:04.860
Parkinson's people are missing l-dopa in

00:06:05.080 00:06:07.170
the brain the fastest easiest way that I

00:06:07.360 00:06:09.420
know you get l-dopa in the brain in

00:06:09.789 00:06:11.010
addition to meditating and healing

00:06:11.740 00:06:14.180
because that can do that is mucuna

00:06:15.190 00:06:16.350
mucuna has l-dopa

00:06:16.599 00:06:18.480
which supports healthy brain functions

00:06:19.169 00:06:23.040
and this supplies the brain with healthy

00:06:24.240 00:06:26.610
natural l-dopa I like this brand a lot

00:06:26.830 00:06:28.769
it's paradise herbs it's wild crafted

00:06:29.650 00:06:31.409
but make sure you get any kind of mucuna

00:06:31.990 00:06:33.839
that is organic this one's not organic

00:06:33.969 00:06:36.149
but it's wild craft which means you know

00:06:36.310 00:06:37.709
it's as close to organic as they can

00:06:37.870 00:06:41.219
make it without certifying it and wild

00:06:41.620 00:06:43.860
crafted it it grows in the wild but you

00:06:44.050 00:06:44.940
can get mucuna

00:06:45.490 00:06:46.740
