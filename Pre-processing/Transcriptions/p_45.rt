00:00:00.450 00:00:02.869
hi my name is Kay I'm 14 years old from

00:00:03.510 00:00:05.360
Manchester and five years ago I was told

00:00:05.490 00:00:08.690
I had Parkinson's disease so what does

00:00:08.790 00:00:10.820
that mean to me well it just gave me

00:00:11.330 00:00:14.079
answers it didn't change my life in any

00:00:15.089 00:00:19.099
significant way fact that now that the

00:00:19.590 00:00:21.950
massive machine medication to check I'm

00:00:22.230 00:00:23.390
lucky enough to still be working

00:00:23.640 00:00:25.220
I work as a teaching assistant in a

00:00:25.590 00:00:27.410
local primary school and the question

00:00:27.750 00:00:29.929
behind me Queen of Hearts

00:00:29.970 00:00:31.730
I had hoped to have been wearing on

00:00:32.160 00:00:33.500
Thursday the World Book Day but instead

00:00:33.660 00:00:35.330
of we're having that because it was a

00:00:35.670 00:00:38.810
snow day I got laptop in woolly hats

00:00:39.329 00:00:41.840
calf warm cloths wellies and went with

00:00:41.969 00:00:44.270
my grandchildren and her local packs and

00:00:44.760 00:00:46.700
ended up sledging I've never done before

00:00:47.309 00:00:50.540
and probably I'll never do again I was

00:00:50.820 00:00:52.610
lucky that day it was a good day I was

00:00:52.800 00:00:56.150
able to walk having Parkinson's is a bit

00:00:56.420 00:01:01.490
like Alice in Wonderland because you

00:01:01.710 00:01:02.959
never know what's happening you never

00:01:03.120 00:01:04.789
know what's going to happen what it's

00:01:04.920 00:01:07.370
your education going to work if you take

00:01:07.500 00:01:08.539
it at the wrong time it can cause

00:01:08.970 00:01:11.060
problems if you take it too early it can

00:01:11.670 00:01:13.130
can be problematic if you if you forget

00:01:13.200 00:01:17.090
a dose it can cause problems you playing

00:01:17.310 00:01:18.440
catch-up with your medication all the

00:01:18.689 00:01:19.969
time because just so she get it right

00:01:20.280 00:01:23.090
your body then decides that it needs

00:01:23.220 00:01:27.410
more while it needs less some days like

00:01:27.840 00:01:30.499
on Thursday I was able to walk a fairly

00:01:30.659 00:01:32.810
good distance and in quite bad weather

00:01:33.000 00:01:35.950
conditions really yeah and other days I

00:01:36.960 00:01:39.020
struggle to do something as simple as

00:01:39.210 00:01:42.530
brushing my hair I struggle to get down

00:01:42.630 00:01:45.830
the stairs to walk I live quite close to

00:01:45.869 00:01:49.069
where I work which is a bonus because

00:01:49.290 00:01:50.300
they don't have to drive in a road after

00:01:50.460 00:01:52.429
the line public transport so if I do

00:01:52.619 00:01:53.600
have a bit difficult to get up in the

00:01:53.939 00:01:56.440
morning it's not so bad and I'm not

00:01:57.450 00:01:58.580
desperately late for work I can still

00:01:59.430 00:02:03.039
nine times out of 10 get to work on time

00:02:04.049 00:02:06.350
working in itself is hard

00:02:07.049 00:02:10.669
somebody with Parkinson's because like I

00:02:10.979 00:02:13.130
say why callest you never know what's

00:02:13.260 00:02:13.590
around the

00:02:13.960 00:02:16.310
corner and you constantly pray and

00:02:17.320 00:02:18.180
please let me get through this day

00:02:18.310 00:02:20.670
without my symptoms becoming a problem

00:02:21.990 00:02:24.660
i slor' I could swear I could freeze on

00:02:24.760 00:02:26.190
the spot I don't want that happening in

00:02:26.500 00:02:29.310
skill I don't want people children to

00:02:29.880 00:02:32.640
witness the this is the worst effects

00:02:32.890 00:02:34.890
that you can have from Parkinson's which

00:02:35.110 00:02:37.970
is the dyskinesia really bad dyskinesia

00:02:38.980 00:02:41.190
it's not nice to witness it's not nice

00:02:41.380 00:02:44.030
to go through it's quite painful and

00:02:45.040 00:02:46.140
when you're out and about and you start

00:02:46.360 00:02:47.640
having these symptoms are you freezing

00:02:48.010 00:02:49.230
and you can't do you found motor skills

00:02:49.360 00:02:52.320
and people are being negative that's

00:02:52.750 00:02:53.750
also hard to deal with

00:02:54.760 00:02:55.950
so let's hoping that Parkinson's

00:02:56.230 00:02:59.190
Awareness Week this year can make people

00:03:00.010 00:03:02.060
understand the condition understand that

00:03:03.070 00:03:06.330
we are people we have feelings and their

00:03:06.640 00:03:08.940
comments their negative comments can be

00:03:09.310 00:03:12.090
very upsetting so let's try and be

00:03:12.580 00:03:14.340
friendly hope your friendly as I said as

00:03:14.380 00:03:16.350
a campaign was through the air people

00:03:16.720 00:03:21.000
need to still hope the friendly and look

00:03:21.160 00:03:23.900
at the person became to the person and

00:03:24.910 00:03:27.180
help the person and let's find a cure

00:03:27.490 00:03:31.490
and help can control and get rid of

00:03:32.500 00:03:36.480
Parkinson's once and for all thank you
