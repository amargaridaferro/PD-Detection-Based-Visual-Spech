00:00:02.429 00:00:03.530
hello guys hope everyone's doing well

00:00:04.020 00:00:05.930
this is episode two and book review

00:00:06.450 00:00:08.780
number two so last week I was reading

00:00:09.210 00:00:11.360
this one the economics have been am i

00:00:11.639 00:00:13.280
holding it right yeah the economics of

00:00:13.380 00:00:15.770
an equality by Thomas Piketty and from

00:00:15.900 00:00:18.230
the video from the kind of intro preview

00:00:18.300 00:00:19.580
of the book you can see that I'm super

00:00:20.000 00:00:22.250
excited super happy and thrilled and

00:00:22.680 00:00:23.720
pumped to dig into it

00:00:25.430 00:00:28.189
ha economics of inequality but now that

00:00:28.230 00:00:30.589
I am done with it I am not hundred

00:00:30.630 00:00:33.410
percent sure what the book was trying to

00:00:33.750 00:00:35.720
achieve or who exactly the target

00:00:36.090 00:00:38.720
audience for this book so everyone knows

00:00:39.270 00:00:41.810
Thomas Piketty has this amazing amazing

00:00:44.300 00:00:47.440
book there is pretty much a textbook in

00:00:48.450 00:00:49.580
economics and modern economics called

00:00:50.100 00:00:52.900
capital now this is absolutely amazing

00:00:53.910 00:00:55.220
you know you may or may not agree with

00:00:55.559 00:00:57.560
his views but it is a well researched

00:00:58.350 00:01:01.069
well put together well-structured book

00:01:01.489 00:01:03.830
right that has a lot of the

00:01:04.530 00:01:07.340
considerations that Piketty actually put

00:01:07.500 00:01:09.830
in in the smaller version the economics

00:01:09.960 00:01:12.140
of inequality that is especially kind of

00:01:12.540 00:01:14.210
focused on the issue of income

00:01:14.520 00:01:15.770
inequality that I'm going to talk about

00:01:15.990 00:01:18.350
in a minute I am Not sure that this book

00:01:18.570 00:01:21.530
has a general appeal for kind of the

00:01:21.810 00:01:24.590
mass market which is completely fine but

00:01:24.810 00:01:26.990
then I'm I think I also think that it's

00:01:27.780 00:01:30.230
actually not not deep enough and not

00:01:31.110 00:01:34.069
contextualized enough to appeal to the

00:01:34.680 00:01:35.929
market that is kind of interested in

00:01:36.750 00:01:37.789
inequalities in economics so just

00:01:38.040 00:01:39.469
comparing these two you right I know

00:01:39.750 00:01:40.999
that they're not supposed to be compared

00:01:41.189 00:01:42.770
but but let me let me just try this here

00:01:43.409 00:01:46.399
so this one is really for people who are

00:01:46.649 00:01:48.770
very much interested in economics who

00:01:50.509 00:01:52.910
are not necessarily economists did not

00:01:53.100 00:01:55.160
necessarily have economics training but

00:01:55.590 00:01:56.719
let's say are familiar with the

00:01:56.850 00:01:59.749
vocabulary and are kind of quite aware

00:02:00.030 00:02:02.719
of the most trends in the economy and

00:02:02.909 00:02:04.999
things of that nature also talking about

00:02:05.369 00:02:08.779
enthusiasm and kind of dedication to the

00:02:09.239 00:02:10.520
subject to be able to go through this

00:02:10.800 00:02:13.350
book you have to be quite

00:02:13.780 00:02:15.710
passionate are quite interested in

00:02:16.720 00:02:18.900
economics of 21st century or the modern

00:02:19.840 00:02:22.230
economics or parts of it right with this

00:02:22.480 00:02:25.080
book what I thought it was supposed to

00:02:25.240 00:02:27.210
be I mean my mind at least this was

00:02:27.550 00:02:30.450
supposed to be an introduction to the

00:02:30.850 00:02:32.970
issue of income inequality and kind of

00:02:33.160 00:02:33.840
what to do with it

00:02:34.420 00:02:37.170
it serves as a great introduction and it

00:02:37.390 00:02:39.480
puts together a lot of the amazing and

00:02:39.520 00:02:42.900
very useful concepts in inequality as a

00:02:43.600 00:02:45.810
social science but it doesn't really

00:02:45.970 00:02:48.150
tell us much more than that so to me

00:02:48.610 00:02:50.300
it's like people who are interested in

00:02:51.310 00:02:53.850
economics of inequality deeply are gonna

00:02:54.130 00:02:56.010
read capital and that have all the

00:02:56.530 00:02:58.380
context around inequalities and how the

00:02:58.840 00:03:00.570
other areas of economics are playing

00:03:00.700 00:03:03.050
around with it whereas people who are

00:03:04.060 00:03:06.000
kind of interested in inequality only

00:03:06.580 00:03:08.640
will go for this book but unfortunately

00:03:09.070 00:03:10.740
this book is not very easy to read and

00:03:11.680 00:03:14.070
it is not very exciting in of itself

00:03:14.350 00:03:16.050
right so you can be excited about the

00:03:16.480 00:03:17.970
concepts in this book but it doesn't

00:03:18.340 00:03:20.280
excite you so that if we compare let's

00:03:20.500 00:03:23.960
say for example right this little book

00:03:24.970 00:03:27.240
inequality and the 1% right you can you

00:03:27.400 00:03:28.530
can even see the difference with the

00:03:28.720 00:03:30.840
book covers like this one is is telling

00:03:30.970 00:03:33.449
you a story and in every chapter it's

00:03:33.970 00:03:36.479
trying to tie the inequality with the

00:03:36.880 00:03:38.699
issues that we're facing kind of on a

00:03:38.950 00:03:40.860
daily basis so what Thomas Piketty is

00:03:41.350 00:03:43.110
trying to do in economics of inequality

00:03:43.299 00:03:45.090
is actually completely different from

00:03:45.580 00:03:47.550
this book inequality in the 1% it's

00:03:48.310 00:03:50.550
almost as if he's not trying to raise

00:03:50.709 00:03:52.320
awareness he's not trying to get more

00:03:52.390 00:03:54.870
people to care about inequality what

00:03:55.060 00:03:57.000
he's doing here is he's outlining in

00:03:57.820 00:04:00.150
economics terms what is going on what

00:04:00.190 00:04:01.620
the what are the different points of

00:04:01.900 00:04:04.800
view and what are the possible

00:04:05.620 00:04:07.310
theoretical solutions to inequalities

00:04:08.320 00:04:10.140
what this book is also really good at is

00:04:11.019 00:04:12.449
looking specifically at a few countries

00:04:12.730 00:04:15.539
say France and the US and sometimes put

00:04:15.670 00:04:18.349
in the quality in the kind of historical

00:04:19.359 00:04:20.849
framework which is I think quite helpful

00:04:21.640 00:04:24.240
but unfortunately it doesn't go any

00:04:24.490 00:04:27.120
further than that so in terms of whether

00:04:27.310 00:04:29.160
should read economics of inequality by

00:04:29.470 00:04:33.300
Thomas Piketty probably no right if

00:04:33.970 00:04:35.720
you're super interested in economics

00:04:36.730 00:04:38.880
reads capital probably don't bother if

00:04:39.580 00:04:41.490
you are not that interested in economics

00:04:41.680 00:04:42.810
but you really want to learn about

00:04:43.540 00:04:44.490
inequality and you really want to get

00:04:44.800 00:04:47.010
into kind of Nittis and gritties and the

00:04:47.770 00:04:49.980
discussion of inequalities of income

00:04:50.400 00:04:53.700
information opportunity this is probably

00:04:53.920 00:04:55.590
not the best starting point if you have

00:04:55.750 00:04:57.690
read everything else you don't want to

00:04:57.850 00:04:59.220
read a huge book and you want to read

00:04:59.560 00:05:00.960
something else about inequality this is

00:05:01.210 00:05:03.030
probably the only time when you should

00:05:03.190 00:05:05.520
go for this one
