00:00:15.050 00:00:20.170
hi so this is my last proper ever vlog

00:00:20.540 00:00:24.700
for PD 365 I feel a real mix of emotions

00:00:25.070 00:00:28.150
I feel relieved that I'm not gonna have

00:00:28.250 00:00:31.990
to do any more editing I feel sad that

00:00:32.509 00:00:33.819
she's not gonna be doing every day

00:00:34.250 00:00:35.319
because it's been a nice way to document

00:00:35.720 00:00:39.520
my life in the last year it's definitely

00:00:39.710 00:00:43.960
been very hard at times to document my

00:00:44.000 00:00:46.060
life because things haven't been easy

00:00:46.850 00:00:49.870
especially this pain in the ass pain in

00:00:49.970 00:00:54.460
the neck and it's been difficult to want

00:00:54.680 00:00:56.740
to get on camera sometimes and sort of

00:00:57.110 00:01:00.390
showing my face and tell my story but

00:01:01.400 00:01:04.770
you know you guys all watching has been

00:01:05.780 00:01:06.880
something that's made it something that

00:01:07.100 00:01:08.770
I feel like I have to do and that's a

00:01:08.930 00:01:10.749
good thing you know you to feel like

00:01:11.030 00:01:13.660
you're needed and that your opinion is

00:01:13.909 00:01:16.270
valid and the story is helping people

00:01:16.460 00:01:18.760
it's a great thing kind of makes it

00:01:19.070 00:01:23.200
easier day-to-day so probably you some

00:01:23.330 00:01:25.270
of my highest moments we're going on the

00:01:30.250 00:01:35.649
bait was amazing anytime we've got to

00:01:35.810 00:01:42.840
share my story on the stage and of that

00:01:43.850 00:01:45.250
spending time with friends and family is

00:01:45.530 00:01:47.730
always great as well

00:01:48.740 00:01:50.410
worst moments anything involving the net

00:01:50.780 00:01:54.370
gritty I realized something about

00:01:55.010 00:01:56.649
halfway through making the video blogs

00:01:57.340 00:02:01.600
and around a sort of 150 that she was

00:02:01.970 00:02:03.160
helping me as well as helping other

00:02:03.200 00:02:04.780
people to actually learn about my

00:02:05.090 00:02:07.990
condition and myself and my life and

00:02:08.149 00:02:09.369
things like that it was really sort of

00:02:09.950 00:02:11.890
exciting process and actually taught me

00:02:11.930 00:02:14.410
a lot about myself which is sounds a bit

00:02:14.629 00:02:18.039
wanky bit it's always nice to know a bit

00:02:18.080 00:02:19.660
more about yourself and what you like

00:02:19.970 00:02:23.280
and what you can handle one thing

00:02:23.319 00:02:25.589
I also started to realize the importance

00:02:25.780 00:02:28.770
of peer support and actually me making

00:02:29.079 00:02:32.069
video blogs was helping other people and

00:02:32.890 00:02:34.740
I didn't really expect that so much I

00:02:35.200 00:02:36.300
thought people might enjoy them perhaps

00:02:37.260 00:02:46.860
but didn't which is a great thing never

00:02:47.439 00:02:50.759
expected that and that's what's leading

00:02:51.069 00:02:53.670
to my new project she's launching today

00:02:54.190 00:02:58.069
my kickstart my Kickstarter crowdfunding

00:02:59.079 00:03:00.300
Kickstarter wouldn't let me on because I

00:03:00.459 00:03:01.890
thought I was peddling drugs of a cure

00:03:02.620 00:03:03.690
and I was like if I was peddling drugs

00:03:04.150 00:03:05.099
work here if there was a cure

00:03:06.000 00:03:07.559
Parkinson's wouldn't need to make this

00:03:07.780 00:03:12.960
work so that guy's just saying so went

00:03:13.269 00:03:13.649
for her

00:03:13.930 00:03:16.830
just giving crowdfunding dogs giving so

00:03:16.930 00:03:17.879
I'm going to be launching my

00:03:18.189 00:03:20.819
crowdfunding for 365.com which is

00:03:21.280 00:03:24.000
basically an online portal for people to

00:03:24.280 00:03:26.580
share video books and to help others and

00:03:27.549 00:03:29.009
I won't just grab it too much on here

00:03:29.199 00:03:30.539
because there's a whole video explaining

00:03:30.819 00:03:32.849
it it's not to do a lot better but I'm

00:03:32.980 00:03:34.770
not wearing a neck brace and it's not

00:03:35.560 00:03:36.899
digging into my chin you think it's

00:03:37.359 00:03:40.050
uncomfortable but I'll put the link up

00:03:40.359 00:03:41.879
please take a look please sure if you

00:03:42.419 00:03:44.159
can because it's something that's led

00:03:44.409 00:03:47.009
directly from this whole experience in

00:03:47.199 00:03:49.080
my experience of sharing and seeing

00:03:49.209 00:03:52.080
other people benefit from the vlogs but

00:03:52.150 00:03:53.879
I just want to say a massive thank you

00:03:54.099 00:03:55.559

in and for supporting me all the love

00:03:57.669 00:03:59.670

00:03:59.799 00:04:02.699
last year and actually opening up my

00:04:02.889 00:04:04.710
life has given me comfort at times when

00:04:04.750 00:04:06.599
I really needed it people I didn't even

00:04:06.819 00:04:09.839
