by Haruki Murakami yeh I'm a Murakami

00:00:20.900 00:00:23.240
fan so why did I pick this up clearly

00:00:23.760 00:00:24.980
because I'm a Murakami fan

00:00:25.410 00:00:28.189
this is his 14th novel and I've read all

00:00:28.800 00:00:31.310
his 13 books and now 14 and his

00:00:31.560 00:00:33.080

00:00:33.480 00:00:35.150
nonfiction alright so and for those who

00:00:35.489 00:00:37.819

49 languages now the thing about

00:00:50.610 00:00:52.610
Murakami is is that his themes are very

00:00:52.920 00:00:55.160
weird it is magic realism it is

00:00:55.920 00:00:57.889
surrealism it is speaker risk it is

00:00:58.620 00:00:59.990
everything that you cannot imagine and

00:01:00.690 00:01:02.029
only if you read them that's when you'll

00:01:02.579 00:01:03.799
understand where he comes from

00:01:04.260 00:01:05.870
what are the places that he goes to and

00:01:06.060 00:01:06.980
what are the places that he takes the

00:01:07.229 00:01:09.469
reader to and he's won awards such as

00:01:14.430 00:01:16.550
fiction alright now let's talk about his

00:01:16.710 00:01:19.130
new book killing common the tall killing

00:01:19.439 00:01:21.200
common at all is a huge book it can be

00:01:21.450 00:01:23.330
used as a doorstop or if you do not like

00:01:23.490 00:01:24.830
reading big books but if you like

00:01:25.110 00:01:26.210
reading big books and this book is just

00:01:26.850 00:01:29.870
for you it is about an unnamed

00:01:30.150 00:01:32.510
protagonist whose wife leaves Samia she

00:01:32.850 00:01:35.030
divorces him he sad he's depressed he's

00:01:35.280 00:01:38.030
lonely and he paints self and he paints

00:01:38.220 00:01:40.999
portraits of people so what does he do

00:01:41.189 00:01:42.889
of course he takes to the mountain like

00:01:43.229 00:01:45.499
any good man would and he wants to just

00:01:45.750 00:01:47.539
live in solitude can I also say that

00:01:48.119 00:01:49.460
solitude was a major theme running

00:01:49.860 00:01:52.069
across all of Murakami's books so he

00:01:52.350 00:01:54.649
goes to the mountains who we shall call

00:01:55.020 00:01:57.530
X or Y or Z you can call him anything he

00:01:57.659 00:02:00.800
has no name in the book a friend offers

00:02:00.960 00:02:02.690
him to live in the mountains and a cabin

00:02:03.060 00:02:05.209
take care of it and while he's there he

00:02:05.549 00:02:08.210
can paint and do whatever he wants so

00:02:08.459 00:02:10.279
that's that but life was not easy for

00:02:10.979 00:02:12.280
Murakami's protagonists

00:02:12.620 00:02:15.039
they have to have something exciting

00:02:15.079 00:02:16.990
going on or something to interrupt their

00:02:17.209 00:02:18.640
day-to-day life so he starts living in

00:02:18.739 00:02:21.069
the cabin and he thinks he's going to

00:02:21.260 00:02:23.679
deliver a very normal life take time to

00:02:23.840 00:02:25.899
get over his wife he's going to paint

00:02:26.239 00:02:28.179
and it's gonna be all good but this is a

00:02:28.700 00:02:30.699
Murakami book and nothing is as easy as

00:02:30.920 00:02:31.330
it seems

00:02:31.939 00:02:34.000
so who does he meet he meets a neighbor

00:02:34.790 00:02:36.789
whose name is men she keep which

00:02:37.069 00:02:39.910
literally means without color haha see

00:02:40.129 00:02:41.740
he's painting portraits he's without

00:02:42.109 00:02:44.830
color so yeah well anyway so that's men

00:02:45.230 00:02:47.559
chickie who's a very Gatsby like

00:02:48.139 00:02:52.289
character with a crop of white hair and

00:02:53.299 00:02:56.140
swanky Jaguars and you know just a very

00:02:56.950 00:02:59.429
extravagant extravagant lifestyle and

00:03:00.439 00:03:04.179
what this guy is all about murakami just

00:03:04.669 00:03:06.759
explains that he is spying on another

00:03:07.400 00:03:09.699
neighbor who lives on a mountain through

00:03:10.040 00:03:12.640
some military binoculars and that

00:03:12.829 00:03:14.409
neighbor happens to be a 13 year old

00:03:14.689 00:03:18.580
girl who could be his daughter when she

00:03:18.769 00:03:20.409
keys daughter that is which I thought

00:03:20.599 00:03:23.559
was very weird and again because it's a

00:03:24.019 00:03:26.110
Murakami book everything happens it's

00:03:26.569 00:03:28.899
it's like a rabbit hole in Alice in

00:03:29.560 00:03:31.629
Wonderland everybody falls into it and

00:03:32.030 00:03:33.610
things happen for no good reason

00:03:34.190 00:03:35.409
sometimes and sometimes a very good

00:03:35.599 00:03:37.089
reason and I am NOT going to tell you

00:03:37.340 00:03:40.210
more about the plot but this is what the

00:03:40.400 00:03:44.860
book is really about in brief and so

00:03:45.500 00:03:46.839
Murakami just paints this world and he

00:03:47.090 00:03:48.490
leaves the reader he doesn't tie any

00:03:48.799 00:03:50.619
loose ends and that he does with every

00:03:50.780 00:03:52.990
book almost all the books that people

00:03:53.329 00:03:54.909
would have read this may seem like a

00:03:55.220 00:03:56.860
rank but it isn't don't get me wrong I

00:03:56.900 00:03:59.500
really really love his books but killing

00:03:59.870 00:04:01.300
comment at all while I love the prose

00:04:01.639 00:04:04.030
and I love the sentences and I love the

00:04:04.159 00:04:05.830
way he writes and all of that and yadda

00:04:05.930 00:04:09.819
yadda yadda but something felt very I

00:04:10.310 00:04:11.710
don't know was a uncomfortable perhaps

00:04:11.930 00:04:14.080
with a 13 year old girl reference I was

00:04:14.900 00:04:16.749
uncomfortable with some of the sex

00:04:17.389 00:04:20.140
imagine than real so that that's just me

00:04:20.299 00:04:23.399
as a reader but I still love the writer

00:04:24.409 00:04:26.050
and most people might even agree or

00:04:26.480 00:04:27.909
disagree with my views but not then

00:04:28.070 00:04:30.070
that's absolutely fine but it's just

00:04:30.470 00:04:32.290
that I was expecting more from this book

00:04:32.960 00:04:35.140
given I'm such a big fan of Murakami not

00:04:35.270 00:04:36.850
that the book disappointed me where was

00:04:37.400 00:04:39.250
alright it was it was a little above

00:04:39.440 00:04:41.950
average and that was it so after all

00:04:42.290 00:04:44.530
this I think monogamy just like any

00:04:44.720 00:04:47.409
other author is extremely self-indulgent

00:04:47.660 00:04:50.080
in this book there's a lot of pros that

00:04:50.150 00:04:52.000
are that could have been done away with

00:04:52.940 00:04:54.940
their Lord of mentioned to genitalia

00:04:55.100 00:04:56.470
that could have been done away with I

00:04:57.470 00:04:59.320
think there was no need of men Shiki as

00:04:59.360 00:05:02.290
a character in itself I think he's just

00:05:02.840 00:05:05.080
too pointless in the book and those are

00:05:05.210 00:05:07.780
my thoughts about the book now you

00:05:07.940 00:05:09.100
should read this book if you really like

00:05:09.650 00:05:11.110
Murakami and you are excited about

00:05:11.570 00:05:13.629
picking up one of his his latest book

00:05:13.820 00:05:15.190
that is and I think you should read it

00:05:15.950 00:05:17.710
definitely engage for yourself or judge

00:05:17.930 00:05:19.210
for yourself whether you like it or not

00:05:19.910 00:05:21.270
you should read this book if you like

00:05:22.280 00:05:25.600
themes of magic realism surrealism you

00:05:25.790 00:05:28.090
like a picaresque novel and you know

00:05:28.370 00:05:29.800
generally excited by such themes in

00:05:30.020 00:05:31.900
books do not read this book if you

00:05:32.330 00:05:34.240
cannot handle big books because in this

00:05:34.400 00:05:36.310
book is definitely not for you there are

00:05:36.710 00:05:38.950
lot of intertwined plots you might lose

00:05:39.200 00:05:41.320
some of the signs and if you are the one

00:05:41.479 00:05:43.390
who cannot read wrong books at a stretch

00:05:43.760 00:05:45.310
then definitely this book isn't for you

00:05:45.800 00:05:47.710
alright so definitely read more akame if

00:05:48.050 00:05:51.159
you like Marquez Milan Kundera Salman

00:05:51.620 00:05:53.320
Rushdie Elizabeth Kostova and Horan

00:05:53.690 00:05:55.659
Pamuk it will lead to a great snooze

00:05:55.910 00:05:58.060
fest no sorry it won't but definitely

00:05:58.280 00:05:59.350
read will have come if you like these

00:05:59.750 00:06:02.140
authors it is as detailed his books are

00:06:02.300 00:06:06.250
as a prose heavy and a lot of

00:06:07.070 00:06:08.710
intertwined plot lines so this book is

00:06:09.020 00:06:11.050
definitely for you if you like such

00:06:11.300 00:06:13.930
books so I give this book one two three
