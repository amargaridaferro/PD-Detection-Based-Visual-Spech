hi if you're watching this video then

00:00:03.360 00:00:04.940
I'm assuming that you either have

00:00:05.700 00:00:07.070
Parkinsons yourself or you know

00:00:07.350 00:00:10.250
something that dogs in my case it's my

00:00:10.710 00:00:12.919
my dad that's got Parkinson's disease

00:00:13.860 00:00:16.180
and this started about eight years ago

00:00:17.190 00:00:20.750
when he was 16 years old and basically

00:00:20.910 00:00:24.650
he got out of bed one day fell over and

00:00:24.869 00:00:29.000
I was a start it took three years to get

00:00:29.160 00:00:32.530
her a diagnosis whether I would anyway

00:00:33.540 00:00:35.810
his GP and several doctors at hospitals

00:00:36.210 00:00:39.790
all said but it wasn't Parkinson's but

00:00:40.800 00:00:42.530
after a couple of brain scans and paying

00:00:43.350 00:00:46.910
to go private it was actually eventually

00:00:47.760 00:00:48.920
diagnosed with Parkinson's disease

00:00:49.440 00:00:51.200
now I'm not having a go at NHS I'm

00:00:51.449 00:00:54.160
really not I think they do a great job

00:00:55.170 00:00:57.979
especially under the circumstances as we

00:00:58.109 00:01:00.380
all know that there's a lot of strain on

00:01:00.539 00:01:03.950
the NHS at the moment now the reason for

00:01:04.080 00:01:06.530
this benefit for this video is not just

00:01:06.810 00:01:11.840
to talk about Parkinson's itself but how

00:01:12.420 00:01:14.359
my dad's improved quite dramatically

00:01:14.670 00:01:19.820
since taking a natural supplement now

00:01:20.070 00:01:22.100
I've obviously got to talk about it does

00:01:22.920 00:01:26.359
Parkinson's from my point of view no I'm

00:01:26.490 00:01:27.920
not particularly comfortable speaking to

00:01:28.049 00:01:30.679
a camera my dad definitely not do this

00:01:31.560 00:01:33.890
but I feel it's important to to talk

00:01:34.049 00:01:35.480
about this and to share this information

00:01:35.820 00:01:39.920
with people so some be dad living with

00:01:40.700 00:01:43.520
Parkinson's is a balancing act he has

00:01:43.860 00:01:46.850
good days and he has bad days and it's

00:01:47.070 00:01:50.300
only got so much energy that he can use

00:01:51.170 00:01:54.590
before it's sort of like his tank is

00:01:54.990 00:01:57.679
empty if he like any company off that

00:02:00.000 00:02:01.370
he's always trying to do as much as he

00:02:01.560 00:02:04.639
can do and he said he's got to try I

00:02:04.860 00:02:06.679
sort of was the alternative is to just

00:02:06.899 00:02:08.570
give in which is it doesn't want to do

00:02:09.319 00:02:11.510
that no over the last few years he's not

00:02:11.610 00:02:11.930
as many

00:02:12.270 00:02:16.400
and put up a few times like that most

00:02:16.940 00:02:20.810
people must be out there know that with

00:02:21.540 00:02:23.660
pockets medication that you do increase

00:02:23.940 00:02:25.460
the stock that you get to a point where

00:02:25.560 00:02:28.880
you can't increase anymore so what is

00:02:29.010 00:02:31.750
this natural supplement well I started

00:02:33.470 00:02:36.200
taking prehistoric plant-based minerals

00:02:36.600 00:02:38.930
about nine months ago and I want to keep

00:02:39.060 00:02:40.520
this pop brief because I know some of

00:02:40.620 00:02:42.650
you might not be interested if you want

00:02:42.780 00:02:45.170
more information click on the subscribe

00:02:45.270 00:02:50.810
button to look up my other videos right

00:02:51.390 00:02:54.590
okay so we are designed as human beings

00:02:55.110 00:02:56.840
to eat plant-based meals every day

00:02:57.780 00:03:02.000
that's a fact but the minerals are found

00:03:02.250 00:03:04.670
in the food today contain a fraction of

00:03:05.280 00:03:08.210
what was found in food in the past now

00:03:08.340 00:03:11.300
for the past eight years this been a

00:03:11.550 00:03:13.760
global decline in minerals found in our

00:03:14.100 00:03:16.690
soil and today we're getting down to

00:03:17.700 00:03:19.130
we'll be down to about eight percent of

00:03:19.290 00:03:19.930
what it once was

00:03:20.940 00:03:22.699
now this has been confirmed by the World

00:03:22.970 00:03:25.850
Health Organization UNICEF the Royal

00:03:26.370 00:03:28.970
Society of Chemistry and it's been

00:03:29.430 00:03:30.680
proven that this is it's affecting our

00:03:31.430 00:03:35.140
health nice or sonic global global basis

00:03:36.150 00:03:39.170
I started taking these because I'm

00:03:39.330 00:03:41.500
getting on a bit I'm 48 years old and

00:03:42.510 00:03:45.140
I've been having a problem with a

00:03:46.790 00:03:48.710
background lethargic tightness I said oh

00:03:48.900 00:03:50.920
where can i I can explain it

00:03:51.930 00:03:53.540
now they caught me so that saw was that

00:03:53.670 00:03:55.190
the minerals they may no health claims

00:03:56.000 00:03:57.680
whatsoever and he's just sort of the

00:03:58.400 00:04:02.449
supplement but I had heard that if you

00:04:02.580 00:04:03.920
know they were good for several

00:04:04.200 00:04:06.070
different things or thought I'd try and

00:04:07.080 00:04:08.810
yes it did help me with my energy and it

00:04:09.000 00:04:11.690
did help me with other things but what

00:04:12.060 00:04:15.710
always amazed that was they cured cured

00:04:15.989 00:04:19.849
a 25 year long illness that I had and

00:04:20.250 00:04:23.430
that was my mental health

00:04:23.550 00:04:27.210
I suffer from anxiety depression are

00:04:27.940 00:04:31.530
struggled with stress and uh quite often

00:04:31.810 00:04:35.670
had suicidal thoughts now again I don't

00:04:35.890 00:04:39.300
want to go into into too much detail on

00:04:39.580 00:04:42.300
this video please if you interested

00:04:42.580 00:04:44.790
check out my other videos but all I want

00:04:44.890 00:04:47.070
to say is that you know I struggled with

00:04:47.410 00:04:51.270
life I really did but feed four months

00:04:51.370 00:04:53.640
of taking these minerals fund I was

00:04:53.980 00:04:55.950
feeling totally different I really you

00:04:55.990 00:04:58.770
know I can't explain I can't emphasize

00:04:59.320 00:05:02.460
how much deeply affected me six months

00:05:02.590 00:05:02.970
down the line

00:05:03.190 00:05:06.710
I was totally depression anxiety free

00:05:08.460 00:05:11.310
and my parents notice it different the

00:05:11.440 00:05:13.920
whole time you noticed a difference and

00:05:14.080 00:05:15.630
so I suggested to her parents that they

00:05:15.940 00:05:18.990
tried these minerals I'll be honest with

00:05:19.210 00:05:20.250
you my dad wasn't particularly

00:05:21.040 00:05:23.760
interested but as all good husband's do

00:05:24.450 00:05:27.600
they do what they told by the wife and

00:05:27.940 00:05:30.690
so they both started taking these

00:05:32.430 00:05:36.150
minerals now with my dad in turn energy

00:05:36.550 00:05:38.460
levels were never particularly good

00:05:39.220 00:05:43.640
since since his boxing's hit they've got

00:05:44.650 00:05:45.870
they've got a decent size gone but the

00:05:46.060 00:05:49.350
lawns not particularly big and it went

00:05:49.510 00:05:51.810
out if he went out and mode that lon

00:05:52.630 00:05:53.820
that would probably be him for the day

00:05:54.040 00:05:58.560
his energy would have been gone now

00:05:59.080 00:06:00.720
another thing with dad no I think it's

00:06:01.150 00:06:02.640
typical with with pockets and sufferers

00:06:03.000 00:06:06.390
is easily shuffle he used to didn't

00:06:06.640 00:06:10.280
really walk he shuffled his head down

00:06:11.290 00:06:13.250
and we just accepted that that was that

00:06:14.260 00:06:17.250
was what my dad that's how much I've got

00:06:17.440 00:06:19.350
that you know and we didn't think that

00:06:19.570 00:06:22.950
would ever change another thing which is

00:06:23.169 00:06:26.700
common up a Davies insta question which

00:06:26.860 00:06:29.880
is understandable really my dad was on

00:06:30.850 00:06:32.490
had been on antidepressants for several

00:06:32.740 00:06:35.100
years although it was

00:06:35.139 00:06:39.689
I love games so the families thought he

00:06:39.939 00:06:43.409
knows the difference with my dad's again

00:06:43.629 00:06:46.800
around relatively once mark he seemed to

00:06:46.900 00:06:48.510
be doing think he'd definitely be doing

00:06:48.789 00:06:50.879
more he had more energy but it was

00:06:51.159 00:06:53.459
walking again he wasn't shuffling he

00:06:53.740 00:06:56.100
still used his walking stick if you went

00:06:56.199 00:07:00.480
out the house it was definitely walking

00:07:01.379 00:07:03.629
better and it was it was my mom that

00:07:03.819 00:07:05.100
kept saying to him that you know the

00:07:05.259 00:07:06.839
middle was a help in you you know and

00:07:06.879 00:07:12.600
the MB dad just laughed but to give you

00:07:12.699 00:07:16.800
an example I see a few weeks ago he went

00:07:17.050 00:07:18.959
out and he mowed the lawn he aged the

00:07:19.180 00:07:22.020
lawn he spent a couple of hours in the

00:07:22.180 00:07:24.180
garden gardening and he went out to a

00:07:24.789 00:07:27.749
circle now pre the minerals discus

00:07:28.060 00:07:31.649
wouldn't have happened it just want to

00:07:31.960 00:07:32.909
it would not have been able to do that

00:07:33.099 00:07:37.679
at all the other thing he is a lot

00:07:38.050 00:07:41.040
happier now I don't know if that's just

00:07:41.319 00:07:44.430
because his um his quality of life has

00:07:44.560 00:07:46.920
improved but he's definitely happier in

00:07:47.699 00:07:50.579
himself he recently went to see his

00:07:50.770 00:07:53.850
doctor his annual checkup and the doctor

00:07:53.979 00:07:56.490
what she said how well he was looking so

00:07:56.740 00:07:57.839
get all the people I know it's from the

00:07:58.240 00:08:01.499
difference in mid in you know my dad now

00:08:02.129 00:08:04.879
the Lords are Parkinson's you know

00:08:05.889 00:08:08.700
there's no cures you know and he still

00:08:08.800 00:08:11.519
has bad days but these bad days aren't

00:08:11.740 00:08:13.409
as bad as they used to be and they're

00:08:13.539 00:08:20.540
not as frequent neither now I've got a

00:08:21.550 00:08:24.510
but say that minerals are not like the

00:08:24.849 00:08:25.619
mineral was that you had to find at your

00:08:25.750 00:08:29.100
local chemist they're just not most

00:08:29.589 00:08:31.260
minerals available to buying metallic

00:08:31.629 00:08:32.699
minerals and again I don't wanna go into

00:08:32.919 00:08:36.569
too much detail because some people are

00:08:36.760 00:08:39.750
just so now but if you want more

00:08:40.360 00:08:41.490
information about the main rooms I've

00:08:41.919 00:08:46.290
put a link below the video I've also put

00:08:46.540 00:08:47.670
my email list

00:08:48.220 00:08:50.040
if you if you want to contact me for any

00:08:50.290 00:08:52.319
reason at all please feel free to do

00:08:52.680 00:08:54.660
that and I'll get back to you as soon as

00:08:54.819 00:08:57.449
I can and I've also put a link down

00:08:57.850 00:08:59.730
there that have commented themselves if

00:08:59.860 00:09:02.910
you wanted to buy the minerals now the

00:09:03.990 00:09:06.359
cell in patna sell the minerals in a

00:09:06.759 00:09:12.210
powdered form they also do a powdered

00:09:12.759 00:09:15.449
minerals in a veggie caps mall and they

00:09:15.639 00:09:17.489
also do some of the courses in minerals

00:09:18.209 00:09:21.749
and that's because you basically I don't

00:09:22.209 00:09:23.970
all add up dirt the minerals to water

00:09:24.189 00:09:26.609
and they sizzle and dissolve and I think

00:09:26.769 00:09:28.439
most people go through these because

00:09:29.410 00:09:31.309
they've deflated

00:09:32.319 00:09:36.629
the company is based in the UK but but

00:09:36.759 00:09:38.460
the minerals are available throughout

00:09:38.949 00:09:46.679
Europe the US and Australia now I know

00:09:46.959 00:09:50.189
what the minerals have done for me and

00:09:50.559 00:09:52.079
my dad and all the people that I know

00:09:52.899 00:09:55.169
and I would suggest you try them

00:09:55.629 00:09:56.699
Purcell's even if you just run it for

00:09:56.800 00:09:57.809
three to four months and see how you

00:09:58.089 00:10:01.110
feel I won't say that they're not cheap

00:10:01.509 00:10:05.069
but let's face it what is nowadays they

00:10:07.170 00:10:12.179
cost 2398 plus postage in the UK 33

00:10:12.399 00:10:18.960
euros in Europe 3398 in America and

00:10:20.790 00:10:22.829
Australia but for me I just think

00:10:22.929 00:10:24.360
they're better health and feeling better

00:10:24.939 00:10:27.059
it is worth spending your little money

00:10:28.319 00:10:30.679
on so that's it

00:10:31.689 00:10:33.090
again if you interest in watching my
