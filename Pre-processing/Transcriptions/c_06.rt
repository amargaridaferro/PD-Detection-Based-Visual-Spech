00:00:00.719 00:00:03.320
hi this is Matt today I'm doing a review

00:00:03.540 00:00:06.700
of Walden by Henry David Thoreau and

00:00:07.710 00:00:10.250
Walden is a classic of literature and

00:00:10.920 00:00:12.650
can also be considered a classic of

00:00:13.559 00:00:14.930
environmental literature as well and

00:00:15.630 00:00:18.019
just before I jump into the review you

00:00:18.060 00:00:20.750
should just note that I am reviewing

00:00:21.330 00:00:22.730
Walden from the perspective of what we

00:00:22.890 00:00:25.519
can learn from it without how to care

00:00:25.560 00:00:28.220
for the natural environment so this is

00:00:28.410 00:00:31.160
not meant as a literary analysis or

00:00:31.470 00:00:33.830
literary criticism it's simply looking

00:00:33.960 00:00:35.660
at the book from an environmentalists

00:00:37.250 00:00:39.830
perspective so that said Walden was

00:00:40.290 00:00:43.190
published by Henry David Thoreau in 1854

00:00:43.610 00:00:47.119
and Thoreau was a man of many talents

00:00:47.370 00:00:50.060
but amongst these he was a writer and a

00:00:50.730 00:00:55.670
naturalist and a philosopher and it's my

00:00:55.770 00:00:57.740
understanding that Thoreau's writing and

00:00:58.170 00:01:00.950
Thoros thinking was kind of considered a

00:01:01.530 00:01:03.399
precursor to what later became the

00:01:04.430 00:01:08.240
modern environmental movement so the

00:01:08.430 00:01:11.179
book itself is an autobiographical

00:01:11.310 00:01:14.600
account of Thoreau's this experiment

00:01:14.729 00:01:17.480
that he did in which he went out into

00:01:17.610 00:01:20.450
the woods near his home town of Concord

00:01:20.759 00:01:23.570
Massachusetts and he'd built a cabin for

00:01:23.970 00:01:26.749
himself and lived in solitude in the

00:01:26.939 00:01:31.190
woods for two years and he was this

00:01:31.619 00:01:33.800
cabin was built next to a pond called

00:01:34.140 00:01:35.749
Walden Pond which is where the food gets

00:01:35.939 00:01:40.310
its name so throughout the book the road

00:01:41.070 00:01:43.850
describes his experiences living in the

00:01:44.040 00:01:46.760
woods and solitude so he spends quite a

00:01:46.979 00:01:49.340
lot of time describing the natural

00:01:49.500 00:01:50.450
environment around him

00:01:50.670 00:01:54.350
and he also devote a lot of time to

00:01:54.930 00:01:57.499
describing exactly how it is he lives so

00:01:57.540 00:02:00.109
he talks about how he built the cabin

00:02:00.829 00:02:04.609
and how he goes about farming vegetables

00:02:04.920 00:02:07.219
and catching fish and just all the sorts

00:02:07.259 00:02:09.109
of things that would occupy the life of

00:02:09.899 00:02:11.670
a hermit living in the woods

00:02:12.670 00:02:14.520
but interweaved or inter woven

00:02:14.890 00:02:17.750
throughout this thorough explores

00:02:18.760 00:02:23.459
various philosophical ideas and to be

00:02:23.769 00:02:27.209
honest I personally found the book quite

00:02:27.519 00:02:30.300
challenging to read because the pace of

00:02:30.489 00:02:33.479
the writing is very slow and as I said

00:02:33.819 00:02:36.089
he explores all these philosophical

00:02:36.400 00:02:39.000
ideas and in doing so Thoreau tends to

00:02:39.129 00:02:40.589
go off on a lot of different tangents

00:02:40.810 00:02:44.390
and refer to a bunch of things which I

00:02:45.400 00:02:46.710
didn't necessarily know very much about

00:02:46.989 00:02:49.110
because I didn't know the context of the

00:02:49.329 00:02:51.420
time period as I said this was written

00:02:51.609 00:02:55.789
in 1854 which is more than 150 years ago

00:02:56.799 00:02:59.640
but that said I think there is most

00:03:00.189 00:03:02.819
certainly a lot of insight and wisdom

00:03:03.280 00:03:06.500
that you can glean from this book and a

00:03:07.510 00:03:08.879
bunch of things a bunch of the key

00:03:09.219 00:03:12.259
themes are especially relevant to modern

00:03:13.269 00:03:14.039
environmental concerns

00:03:14.980 00:03:20.119
so first Thoreau is very critical of

00:03:21.129 00:03:24.979
consumers and and materialism and this

00:03:25.989 00:03:27.390
actually came as something of a surprise

00:03:27.849 00:03:30.629
to me because I thought that given the

00:03:30.760 00:03:33.509
book was written in 1854 this would be

00:03:33.849 00:03:36.539
well before the modern consumer age you

00:03:36.760 00:03:38.159
know the fall the time of us being

00:03:39.099 00:03:41.009
flooded with adverts to buy the the next

00:03:41.470 00:03:44.219
newest latest thing but I guess you know

00:03:44.500 00:03:46.589
back even more than 150 years ago people

00:03:46.720 00:03:50.969
were still like they are today wanting

00:03:51.099 00:03:54.119
to upgrade wanting to accumulate more

00:03:54.669 00:03:56.009
material stuff from the hope that it

00:03:56.609 00:03:58.319
would give them some kind of

00:03:58.659 00:04:03.119
satisfaction or happiness and so this

00:04:03.430 00:04:05.369
really ties in with the core theme of

00:04:05.500 00:04:08.460
the book which is the value of living

00:04:09.009 00:04:12.059
simply and so this whole experiment that

00:04:12.340 00:04:14.670
Thoreau did by going out into the woods

00:04:14.949 00:04:17.520
and living by himself for two years was

00:04:17.859 00:04:21.029
an exercise in simple living so he

00:04:21.279 00:04:22.890
wanted to see what would happen

00:04:23.470 00:04:26.760
to him what he would feel like to live

00:04:27.100 00:04:29.460
with just the bare essentials for life

00:04:29.860 00:04:31.890
and he didn't he'd find that he could

00:04:32.139 00:04:38.189
live a good and satisfactory life full

00:04:38.229 00:04:41.670
of contentment in this setting

00:04:41.949 00:04:44.610
the other theme that is I think is

00:04:44.860 00:04:47.790
really important in the book is the

00:04:48.220 00:04:51.029
value of spending time connecting or

00:04:51.850 00:04:55.680
reconnecting with nature and the just

00:04:55.810 00:04:58.290
the joy and wonder that Thoreau feels at

00:04:59.289 00:05:02.279
getting to spend time in nature is is

00:05:02.710 00:05:04.219
very apparent throughout the whole book

00:05:05.229 00:05:08.700
and I think by reading Walden we can

00:05:09.010 00:05:12.570
kind of vicariously experience

00:05:13.539 00:05:15.480
Thoros experiences we can vicariously

00:05:16.110 00:05:19.320
feel what it's like to to live this life

00:05:19.630 00:05:22.080
of solitude because not all of us so

00:05:22.509 00:05:23.909
most of us are not going to have the

00:05:24.220 00:05:26.580
time or the inclination to go and spend

00:05:27.010 00:05:28.680
two years out in the wilderness by

00:05:30.150 00:05:33.870
and so by reading Walden that I think we

00:05:34.530 00:05:37.890
can really get some inspiration that

00:05:38.020 00:05:41.550
will help us to reconnect with nature

00:05:42.220 00:05:44.159
and and learn to appreciate it more and

00:05:44.949 00:05:46.469
of course if people learn to appreciate

00:05:47.260 00:05:50.360
nature more than they will most probably

00:05:51.370 00:05:54.439
feel more compelled to care for it

00:05:55.449 00:05:58.980
so to summarize a little bit cautious

00:05:59.680 00:06:02.339
about recommending Walden to everyone

00:06:03.000 00:06:06.120
because as I said it is a tough read at

00:06:06.190 00:06:09.240
least for me it was you know and if

00:06:09.370 00:06:11.490
you're not that well acquainted with

00:06:11.979 00:06:14.659
reading literary fiction or nonfiction

00:06:15.690 00:06:19.050
it it can be pretty difficult to get

00:06:19.240 00:06:22.790
through it you might find it boring even

00:06:23.800 00:06:26.339
if you would be interested in a book

00:06:26.860 00:06:29.550
that is covers similar themes to Walden

00:06:30.370 00:06:32.700
but is not necessarily well is more

00:06:33.370 00:06:35.129
accessible and more modern more easy to

00:06:35.440 00:06:36.239
read then

00:06:36.879 00:06:38.819
highly recommend a sand County Almanac

00:06:39.609 00:06:43.019
by Aldo Leopold and I've done a review

00:06:43.089 00:06:45.049
of that it's a fantastic book

00:06:46.059 00:06:49.889
but that said walden is a classic for a

00:06:49.959 00:06:53.039
reason and I think if you have the

00:06:53.469 00:06:56.059
patience and you're able to digest

00:06:57.069 00:06:58.979
Thoreau's writing then there most

00:06:59.079 00:07:01.679
certainly is beauty and wisdom and

00:07:02.139 00:07:05.009
insight and inspiration to be found in

00:07:05.259 00:07:09.539
the pages of this book so that concludes

00:07:09.939 00:07:11.219
the review and I would just like to

00:07:11.619 00:07:13.799
close with a quote from the book and

00:07:14.589 00:07:16.229
this is probably the most famous quote

00:07:16.479 00:07:19.769
in Walden and in it Thoreau describes

00:07:20.759 00:07:23.429
his motivation for doing this whole

00:07:23.889 00:07:28.169
experiment I went to the woods because I

00:07:28.329 00:07:31.139
wished to live deliberately to front

00:07:31.599 00:07:35.849
only the essential facts of life and see

00:07:35.949 00:07:37.319
if I could not learn what it had to

00:07:37.709 00:07:40.709
teach and not when I came to die

00:07:41.099 00:07:45.149
discover that I had not lived
