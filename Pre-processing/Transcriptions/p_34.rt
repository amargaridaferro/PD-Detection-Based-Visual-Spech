00:00:00.089 00:00:02.659
I was in the kitchen I had a coffee pot

00:00:03.480 00:00:04.490
with my left hand

00:00:05.370 00:00:07.820
filling it under the sink and my hand

00:00:08.250 00:00:11.419
started to shake uncontrollably and the

00:00:11.580 00:00:13.940
only way it stopped was when I grabbed

00:00:14.130 00:00:20.599
it with my left or my right hand so you

00:00:20.760 00:00:23.710
know thought that was weird but then

00:00:24.720 00:00:28.040
moved on until two weeks later the same

00:00:28.910 00:00:30.919
scenario coffee pot under the sink

00:00:31.920 00:00:33.680
started shaking uncontrollably the only

00:00:33.809 00:00:35.959
way to stop it was with my right hand

00:00:39.050 00:00:42.200
and so it began to happen more

00:00:42.270 00:00:44.990
frequently but certainly not all the

00:00:45.180 00:00:48.590
time every day your median age for

00:00:49.559 00:00:51.319
dealing with Parkinson's is a 65 year

00:00:51.449 00:00:53.630
old white man I don't fit that criteria

00:00:54.449 00:00:56.990
and that's when he sent me to dr. Joseph

00:00:57.510 00:00:58.729
Jacob it at Baylor College of Medicine

00:00:59.570 00:01:02.540
who specialized in Parkinson's he has

00:01:02.789 00:01:05.420
the movement disorder clinic at Baylor

00:01:05.880 00:01:09.469
so I went to him and that was about a

00:01:09.780 00:01:11.240
month and a half after being diagnosed

00:01:12.119 00:01:16.399
he immediately put me on Sinemet and you

00:01:16.530 00:01:20.359
know it's the the gold standard for

00:01:21.119 00:01:23.840
Parkinson's medication and for me it was

00:01:23.880 00:01:26.510
a game changer I went from not being

00:01:26.700 00:01:29.240
able to type not being able to function

00:01:29.700 00:01:32.359
with my left arm in order to move it

00:01:32.400 00:01:36.230
I used my right to being able to type

00:01:36.479 00:01:40.880
within 48 hours I was able to rekindle

00:01:42.560 00:01:47.780
my independence I try and stay balanced

00:01:48.060 00:01:50.240
I try to stay balanced with my meds with

00:01:50.430 00:01:53.590
my mood with my child with my exercise

00:01:54.649 00:01:56.990
just everything needs to stay in balance

00:01:57.509 00:02:00.289
and as little stress as possible it is

00:02:00.659 00:02:04.639
my best way of life then around

00:02:06.409 00:02:09.710
Thanksgiving there was a Groupon for a

00:02:10.470 00:02:12.770
ninja class in Houston

00:02:12.870 00:02:15.560
and it was about an hour away and I

00:02:15.770 00:02:19.940
thought another sign from God so I got

00:02:20.100 00:02:21.710
my two Groupons I thought that's all on

00:02:21.930 00:02:27.200
me and I submitted my tape and four

00:02:27.630 00:02:30.470
months later I got the call and competed

00:02:30.810 00:02:35.000
in Oklahoma City I was completely

00:02:35.660 00:02:40.550
unprepared which to be honest not one

00:02:41.070 00:02:43.190
person that tries out for American Ninja

00:02:43.230 00:02:45.710
Warrior is prepared and there are some

00:02:46.530 00:02:50.080
incredible athletes but it's their job

00:02:51.090 00:02:54.729
the people that make these obstacles to

00:02:55.739 00:02:59.229
create obstacles that nobody can surpass

00:03:01.070 00:03:06.350
so it was never I'm gonna be the next

00:03:06.480 00:03:10.490
American Ninja Warrior it was I want to

00:03:10.830 00:03:14.479
prove to people out there that despite

00:03:14.670 00:03:19.210
your obstacles despite your shortcomings

00:03:20.220 00:03:21.500
there's nothing in this world that you

00:03:21.750 00:03:24.789
can't accomplish in one former fashion

00:03:25.799 00:03:28.280
it was never to hit that buzzer it was

00:03:28.680 00:03:33.190
to say if I can do it you can too

00:03:34.200 00:03:37.009
something that I typically tell people

00:03:37.739 00:03:41.569
is there's an I don't have any extreme

00:03:43.070 00:03:47.060
talents but I just do stupid things that

00:03:47.820 00:03:52.490
most people would never try and I had

00:03:53.280 00:03:54.800
always my entire life wanted to be

00:03:55.500 00:03:57.830
artist my sister was artistic I was

00:03:58.470 00:04:01.009
crafty I was creative but I was never

00:04:01.739 00:04:03.410
artistic I couldn't draw to save my life

00:04:05.840 00:04:09.610
and my daughter needed something for

00:04:10.620 00:04:13.370
school and I'd drawn this Minnie Mouse

00:04:14.100 00:04:17.170
freehand and I was like that is not bad

00:04:20.209 00:04:23.900
and so I began drawing and not every

00:04:24.120 00:04:26.160
drawing turns out but when they do there

00:04:26.350 00:04:30.540
pretty amazing and more than anything

00:04:31.260 00:04:33.840
it's you know I've never had any art

00:04:34.330 00:04:38.430
lessons I have no formal direction but I

00:04:38.770 00:04:42.300
think that gives such a bigger story to

00:04:43.240 00:04:49.500
my pieces and again it's it's not so

00:04:49.860 00:04:52.860
much that I have this natural-born

00:04:53.170 00:04:58.500
Talent which I actually do but it's that

00:04:58.540 00:05:02.730
I simply tried so I saw a list and it

00:05:02.830 00:05:05.640
was like top 10 ways to boost dopamine

00:05:05.950 00:05:11.460
and one of those is art sleeping boost

00:05:12.100 00:05:16.880
dopamine art boost up Amin music

00:05:18.480 00:05:20.910
exercise and I don't really remember the

00:05:21.550 00:05:24.630
rest of the list but you know anything

00:05:25.000 00:05:27.530
that's therapeutic anything that that

00:05:28.540 00:05:32.130
releases stress and stress is our

00:05:32.380 00:05:35.010
biggest enemy nice mission and messages

00:05:35.260 00:05:40.440
to really you know focus on creating a

00:05:40.510 00:05:46.020
better life in this world so that my

00:05:47.070 00:05:50.220
daughter can have the best life

00:05:50.860 00:05:53.700
imaginable she can I'm giving her

00:05:53.980 00:05:56.190
lessons that I would never be able to

00:05:56.500 00:06:04.040
teach her otherwise she has no idea that

00:06:05.050 00:06:08.670
essentially I will probably die with

00:06:11.040 00:06:13.790
Parkinson's she knows it causes a shake

00:06:15.210 00:06:17.370
but she also knows that I'm the

00:06:17.800 00:06:20.730
strongest person that she's ever met she

00:06:20.980 00:06:24.030
knows that Mommy will be there no matter

00:06:25.350 00:06:31.740
what she knows that I am a cool mom

00:06:32.650 00:06:35.790
because I've been on TV yeah

00:06:36.340 00:06:39.689
Shh she's getting to see some amazing

00:06:41.699 00:06:44.330
truths that she wouldn't have gotten

00:06:45.340 00:06:49.080
without Parkinson's and not to me you

00:06:49.240 00:06:53.879
know is incredible i I want her to know

00:06:54.430 00:06:59.010
that and in the end throughout all of

00:06:59.500 00:07:02.730
life's ups and downs that I tried my

00:07:02.979 00:07:14.519
hardest and in particular for her
