hello my name is Carl sterling I'm the

00:00:07.859 00:00:09.470
president and the CEO of physio chains

00:00:10.320 00:00:11.480
education and the creator of the

00:00:11.969 00:00:13.400
Parkinson's regeneration training

00:00:13.830 00:00:16.310
program in this video I'd like to share

00:00:16.590 00:00:18.260
some of the highlights of what we teach

00:00:18.510 00:00:21.380
and our workshops all over the world our

00:00:21.720 00:00:24.140
goal is to help the person with PD to

00:00:24.570 00:00:27.020
improve balance stability mobility

00:00:27.990 00:00:30.350
movement to reduce Falls and to improve

00:00:31.020 00:00:33.470
overall quality of life we start off by

00:00:33.719 00:00:35.600
talking about what is Parkinson's

00:00:36.030 00:00:37.910
disease we talk about motor symptoms and

00:00:38.400 00:00:40.490
non-motor symptoms in addition to how

00:00:40.860 00:00:43.220
might PD affect a person we have a

00:00:43.680 00:00:45.470
multitude of professionals in attendance

00:00:45.630 00:00:47.600
at our workshops physiotherapists

00:00:48.120 00:00:49.549
personal trainers movement specialists

00:00:49.739 00:00:51.380
people from the medical world but best

00:00:51.600 00:00:53.810
of all we have people with Parkinson's

00:00:54.170 00:00:56.750
and caregivers at each event and this

00:00:57.149 00:00:59.299
allows the best opportunity for learning

00:01:00.030 00:01:01.670
we teach a number of assessments

00:01:02.280 00:01:04.639
including gait movement and fall risk

00:01:05.309 00:01:06.980
assessments and this helps us to gather

00:01:07.259 00:01:10.129
data on each attendee from there we're

00:01:10.259 00:01:11.629
going to go right into our Parkinson's

00:01:12.240 00:01:14.239
regeneration programming for each client

00:01:14.609 00:01:16.370
this will include dozens of strategies

00:01:16.619 00:01:17.959
and techniques that we have found to be

00:01:18.329 00:01:20.690
most effective that transfer over to

00:01:21.270 00:01:23.690
daily life activities highlights of our

00:01:24.240 00:01:26.120
programming include rolling patterns it

00:01:26.549 00:01:28.849
is not uncommon to have a person come in

00:01:29.009 00:01:31.639
who has lost the ability to roll over so

00:01:31.920 00:01:34.010
far we have 100 percent success rate and

00:01:35.009 00:01:36.440
giving them the ability to leverage

00:01:36.869 00:01:38.749
their body to roll over again

00:01:39.479 00:01:41.510
the vestibular test and reset is one of

00:01:41.579 00:01:43.849
the most powerful techniques to help a

00:01:44.039 00:01:45.949
person get stronger and to move better

00:01:46.740 00:01:48.440
while many people with parkinson's often

00:01:48.630 00:01:51.019
have a stooped over posture we use

00:01:51.990 00:01:53.449
kinesiology taping techniques to help to

00:01:54.209 00:01:56.149
gradually bring them into a more upright

00:01:56.819 00:01:59.239
posture which helps them to improve gait

00:01:59.490 00:02:02.089
and movement patterns while people with

00:02:02.489 00:02:05.749
PD oftentimes have compromised Gate gait

00:02:06.179 00:02:07.669
training is a very big part of our

00:02:07.919 00:02:10.309
program we learn benefits of barefoot

00:02:11.099 00:02:13.010
training barefoot stimulation we know

00:02:13.200 00:02:14.480
that the skin on the bottom of the feet

00:02:14.640 00:02:15.650
is connected to the central nervous

00:02:16.020 00:02:17.990
system and to the brain

00:02:18.120 00:02:20.030
we wake up the small nerve endings on

00:02:20.220 00:02:22.190
the plantar skin we wake up the nervous

00:02:22.530 00:02:24.740
system wake up the brain and we improve

00:02:25.290 00:02:27.500
movement with rigidity oftentimes being

00:02:27.750 00:02:30.170
a motor symptom for a person with PD we

00:02:30.480 00:02:32.750
find that vibration techniques can be

00:02:33.120 00:02:36.320
very helpful vibration as you see in

00:02:36.480 00:02:38.810
this clip can help to release some of

00:02:38.970 00:02:41.180
those overactive and tight muscles we

00:02:41.370 00:02:44.090
can use vibration as another method of

00:02:44.670 00:02:46.040
waking up the plantar skin and

00:02:47.010 00:02:48.410
additionally to wake up the skin on the

00:02:48.660 00:02:50.750
palms of our hands and we often use the

00:02:51.330 00:02:53.300
vibrating roller or vibrating ball to do

00:02:53.640 00:02:56.270
various exercises this helps to wake up

00:02:56.400 00:02:58.699
the nervous system and improve movement

00:02:59.220 00:03:01.699
stability balance and mobility cognitive

00:03:01.950 00:03:03.440
training especially during focused

00:03:03.900 00:03:05.930
movement is a hallmark of our education

00:03:05.970 00:03:08.390
system this helps to improve dual

00:03:08.970 00:03:11.060
tasking multi tasking abilities and to

00:03:11.400 00:03:13.790
reduce Falls we concentrate on three

00:03:14.100 00:03:16.280
types of cognitive training the first

00:03:16.500 00:03:19.460
one that you see here involves a direct

00:03:20.010 00:03:21.170
recall type of training this would be

00:03:21.390 00:03:23.060
something like spelling words backwards

00:03:23.910 00:03:25.490
maybe doing a math equation saying the

00:03:25.650 00:03:26.960
alphabet backwards and things of that

00:03:27.150 00:03:29.539
nature during a focused movement we also

00:03:29.880 00:03:31.699
do a form of cognitive training called

00:03:32.459 00:03:33.860
decision-making as you can see in this

00:03:34.110 00:03:36.440
video the gentleman's being constructed

00:03:36.660 00:03:38.900
and cued on which glove to hit with we

00:03:39.060 00:03:40.910
can progress this by saying that

00:03:41.370 00:03:43.130
whatever we tell the client to do they

00:03:43.320 00:03:44.810
have to do the opposite and in this

00:03:45.180 00:03:46.580
video you'll see that the gentleman is

00:03:47.220 00:03:49.370
boxing and at the same time he is

00:03:49.980 00:03:52.490
telling us how to get from the facility

00:03:52.680 00:03:55.039
that were boxing in to his house he's

00:03:55.410 00:03:56.990
giving us directions as if we were to

00:03:57.239 00:03:58.580
drive to his house this helps to

00:03:58.620 00:04:00.590
activate the brain in a different way

00:04:01.440 00:04:03.380
balance and agility training are a big

00:04:03.720 00:04:05.630
part of our programming in addition

00:04:06.150 00:04:08.720
because we know that rotations can be a

00:04:09.120 00:04:11.020
trigger for freezing of gait and

00:04:12.030 00:04:14.150
increase the risk of falling we practice

00:04:14.940 00:04:16.670
rotations at every workshop and at every

00:04:17.100 00:04:19.340
session hand-eye coordination especially

00:04:19.620 00:04:21.860
during a balanced exercise is a very

00:04:22.200 00:04:24.409
powerful technique perturbation training

00:04:24.510 00:04:26.240
is another powerful technique to

00:04:26.700 00:04:28.219
challenge the balance the center of

00:04:28.380 00:04:30.810
gravity of the client in this

00:04:31.150 00:04:32.280
particular video we're doing

00:04:33.220 00:04:34.680
perturbation training while he's saying

00:04:34.870 00:04:36.780
the alphabet backwards to fire up the

00:04:36.970 00:04:39.600
brain even more we implement exercises

00:04:40.090 00:04:42.210
that activate what we call the big four

00:04:42.790 00:04:44.240
this would be the simultaneous

00:04:45.250 00:04:47.100
activation of the vestibular system by

00:04:47.170 00:04:48.990
turning the head visual system by having

00:04:49.360 00:04:51.360
the eyes tracking we're doing this

00:04:51.790 00:04:53.370
during a focused movement and then the

00:04:53.680 00:04:55.170
fourth item we put on would either be

00:04:55.990 00:04:57.480
cognitive training hand-eye coordination

00:04:58.360 00:05:00.120
or performing the movement on a

00:05:01.090 00:05:04.990
proprioceptive lee enriched environment

00:05:05.750 00:05:07.270
these are just a few of the movements

00:05:07.400 00:05:08.860
and techniques and fall reduction

00:05:09.440 00:05:10.870
strategies that we use at our workshops

00:05:11.510 00:05:13.480
so for more information or to get signed

00:05:13.700 00:05:16.000

00:05:17.870 00:05:19.480
thanks very much for watching hope to

00:05:19.820 00:05:23.230
see you at an event real soon
