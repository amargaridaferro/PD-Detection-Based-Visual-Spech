00:04:28.919 00:04:31.469
character but I can do things that most

00:04:31.690 00:04:34.879
of the people cannot do I close my teeth

00:04:35.889 00:04:40.350

00:04:40.900 00:04:45.719
harder and harder until my my legs

00:04:46.180 00:04:48.800
bleeding of the bar this from the bar

00:04:49.810 00:04:52.219
