hey what's up john sonmez is here so

00:00:02.190 00:00:04.880
today i've got a book review for you and

00:00:04.980 00:00:07.099
this book is a book that was recommended

00:00:07.470 00:00:10.310
to me it's called letting go is by David

00:00:10.800 00:00:11.900
R Hawkins

00:00:12.590 00:00:15.860
okay you can check it out here and this

00:00:16.020 00:00:18.529
was an interesting book to say at least

00:00:19.470 00:00:21.320
very very interesting the basic concept

00:00:21.449 00:00:24.040
of basic premise of the book is that in

00:00:25.050 00:00:27.170
dealing with like emotions the important

00:00:27.269 00:00:29.419
thing to do is to essentially experience

00:00:29.670 00:00:31.220
them but then let them go this is a

00:00:31.800 00:00:33.260
concept that I've been familiar with for

00:00:33.360 00:00:34.970
a while something that if you talk to

00:00:35.250 00:00:36.530
Tony Robbins if you listen to a lot of

00:00:36.719 00:00:38.720
his materials much is newer material it

00:00:39.420 00:00:40.819
very much echoes this is this idea of

00:00:41.399 00:00:43.760
almost like you feel the thing you see

00:00:43.920 00:00:46.910
it you you you acknowledge it you accept

00:00:46.980 00:00:48.889
that it that exists this anger right

00:00:49.110 00:00:50.200
it's like observing yourself

00:00:51.210 00:00:52.189
experiencing this and then you're

00:00:52.500 00:00:53.779
letting it go you're not allowing it to

00:00:54.180 00:00:56.840
manifest take to stay with you to -

00:00:57.270 00:00:58.520
you're not a you're not suppressing it

00:00:58.890 00:01:00.670
you're not expressing it you're just

00:01:01.680 00:01:03.260
accepting it seeing it happen and then

00:01:03.629 00:01:05.030
surrender cerner sort of that

00:01:05.850 00:01:07.850
surrendering letting it go right which

00:01:08.010 00:01:09.649
is hard and it also applies to just like

00:01:10.200 00:01:12.080
everything in life right - basically to

00:01:12.270 00:01:14.359
be in a state of surrender or acceptance

00:01:15.030 00:01:18.350
where you are just basically allowing

00:01:18.840 00:01:21.109
whatever exists to exist not fighting it

00:01:21.450 00:01:22.160
okay it doesn't mean that you don't have

00:01:22.200 00:01:23.899
a purpose or a drive but it means that

00:01:24.240 00:01:25.550
you're just accepting everything right

00:01:26.040 00:01:28.580
accepting what what is and then letting

00:01:28.770 00:01:30.980
it go not not creating an attachment not

00:01:31.350 00:01:32.960
creating a desired outcome letting these

00:01:33.030 00:01:34.789
things happen letting things go which i

00:01:34.860 00:01:36.499
think is really powerful concept I think

00:01:36.750 00:01:38.510
it's really important to to understand

00:01:38.640 00:01:39.830
this in life - there I did another book

00:01:39.869 00:01:40.910
review on a book called radical

00:01:41.220 00:01:42.920
acceptance very similar concept but I

00:01:43.140 00:01:44.420
did these concepts I think you'll find

00:01:44.939 00:01:46.490
echoed throughout history throughout a

00:01:46.890 00:01:48.230
lot of Eastern philosophy and teachings

00:01:48.810 00:01:51.649
and even the Stoics right the best way

00:01:51.899 00:01:54.319
to deal with emotions of being human is

00:01:54.630 00:01:57.050
to accept them not to deny them not to

00:01:57.240 00:01:58.550
try to fight them right you know if

00:01:58.680 00:02:00.620
you're a problem with anger you're not

00:02:00.719 00:02:01.999
gonna solve that by trying not to get

00:02:02.100 00:02:03.859
angry and you're not gonna solve that by

00:02:04.380 00:02:05.030
expressing your anger and you're not

00:02:05.130 00:02:06.350
gonna solve that by suppressing your

00:02:06.570 00:02:07.850
anger the way you're gonna solve it is

00:02:08.069 00:02:09.589
by saying hey oh that's interesting

00:02:09.780 00:02:12.460
I'm feeling angry right now observing it

00:02:13.890 00:02:15.860
and saying okay it's okay it's part of

00:02:16.710 00:02:19.040
being human it's part of its normal but

00:02:19.260 00:02:20.510
I'm not gonna hang on to the anger the

00:02:20.700 00:02:22.340
thing that's made me angry I'm gonna let

00:02:22.380 00:02:23.450
it go I'm not gonna hang on to the

00:02:23.730 00:02:24.800
motion I'm not gonna take ownership of

00:02:24.960 00:02:26.900
it I'm not gonna enjoy it I'm just going

00:02:27.030 00:02:29.360
to say it's here it'll be here for

00:02:30.150 00:02:32.180
however long it's here and let it go

00:02:32.400 00:02:33.770
right and that's kind of the concept

00:02:34.170 00:02:36.530
here the book also goes into kind of

00:02:36.930 00:02:38.990
levels of consciousness this it does get

00:02:39.030 00:02:41.690
a little bit into even for me the woowoo

00:02:42.120 00:02:43.520
zone I will warn you about this but

00:02:43.740 00:02:46.250
again I think there's some value from

00:02:46.470 00:02:47.810
the concept even if some of the stuff

00:02:48.090 00:02:49.340
goes a little bit far with muscle

00:02:49.800 00:02:51.500
testing I'm not a big fan of the whole

00:02:51.750 00:02:52.670
muscle testing thing I think there's

00:02:52.830 00:02:54.620
some validity to it but it does it does

00:02:54.900 00:02:56.690
sound like a lot of hocus-pocus to some

00:02:56.970 00:02:58.760
degree to me and then like he's got

00:02:58.860 00:03:00.410
these levels of consciousness which make

00:03:00.450 00:03:02.540
a lot of sense again not scientifically

00:03:03.090 00:03:05.480
proven even though some of the the book

00:03:05.640 00:03:07.190
would which would try to indicate that

00:03:07.830 00:03:09.440
but they make sense you know rising

00:03:09.780 00:03:11.570
levels of awareness from like the lowest

00:03:11.880 00:03:13.280
levels of consciousness being like at

00:03:13.410 00:03:16.880
the apathy or guilt or shame right to

00:03:17.610 00:03:18.620
anger right where you're actually doing

00:03:18.900 00:03:20.780
something about to confidence and I

00:03:21.000 00:03:22.760
think to like acceptance and then where

00:03:22.860 00:03:23.570
does it go from there

00:03:23.790 00:03:26.000
like love and like so and these higher

00:03:26.310 00:03:27.110
levels of consciousness where you're

00:03:27.650 00:03:30.020
operating that at a higher level that

00:03:30.720 00:03:31.520
that there's gonna be much more

00:03:31.950 00:03:34.040
effective in life right so there's some

00:03:34.470 00:03:36.199
stories in there that are kind of I'm

00:03:36.240 00:03:37.940
not so sure about him healing his own

00:03:38.390 00:03:40.430
vision right kind of by believing and

00:03:40.830 00:03:42.680
stuff like that that I'm not quite so

00:03:42.959 00:03:44.449
sure that I'm buying I'm not like

00:03:44.640 00:03:47.180
completely saying it's not possible but

00:03:47.340 00:03:48.710
they seem like they're stretch a little

00:03:48.870 00:03:51.199
bit to me but again that doesn't nullify

00:03:51.810 00:03:53.210
a lot of the value in the concepts of

00:03:53.520 00:03:55.430
this book like try letting go try

00:03:56.400 00:03:58.220
accepting right try experiencing life

00:03:58.500 00:04:00.470
and on its own terms and allowing your

00:04:00.690 00:04:02.240
emotions to exist and accepting them

00:04:02.400 00:04:03.650
without judgment and you're gonna

00:04:03.990 00:04:06.170
benefit as a human being so while I

00:04:06.750 00:04:08.750
appreciate the book and I appreciate a

00:04:08.850 00:04:10.250
lot of the concepts it's not one that I

00:04:10.470 00:04:12.140
would like super highly recommend I

00:04:12.330 00:04:13.520
think there's probably other books that

00:04:14.040 00:04:16.250
don't go so far into what I call the

00:04:16.470 00:04:19.070
twilight zone um if you can handle that

00:04:19.470 00:04:21.020
okay and you're not going to quote drink

00:04:21.090 00:04:22.580
the kool-aid and you're not gonna like

00:04:22.979 00:04:24.409
become super set skeptical of the other

00:04:24.540 00:04:26.000
ideas then this would be a good book for

00:04:27.250 00:04:30.330
you know but in general because of that

00:04:30.670 00:04:32.010
nature of it's hard for me to recommend

00:04:32.200 00:04:33.030
it because I'm not gonna be able to get

00:04:33.190 00:04:34.890
behind it 100% and say yes I agree with

00:04:35.050 00:04:36.210
all this stuff but there like I said

00:04:36.490 00:04:38.730
there's some value from it so check it

00:04:38.830 00:04:41.970
out at your own at your own peril or

00:04:42.580 00:04:44.850
whatever again I think it's good I would

00:04:44.980 00:04:46.830
give it a thumbs up but I can't give it

00:04:47.020 00:04:48.990
like a I guess I can give it one up so I

00:04:49.210 00:04:50.880
can't give it two thumbs up because of

00:04:51.220 00:04:52.110
some of the content there with the

00:04:52.420 00:04:53.790
muscle testing in in the appendix and

00:04:53.980 00:04:55.440
stuff like that that's it seems a little

00:04:55.750 00:04:58.050
far out there but but practicing the

00:04:58.540 00:05:00.780
concept of letting go totally legit

00:05:01.300 00:05:02.010
totally agree with it

00:05:02.680 00:05:04.200
definitely something that changed my

00:05:05.010 00:05:07.560
life majorly right I have very little

00:05:08.050 00:05:09.720
like as far as like emotional baggage

00:05:10.420 00:05:11.850
emotional stress like drama in my life

00:05:12.250 00:05:14.190
it's almost zero you know since I

00:05:14.350 00:05:16.140
started doing this which was well before

00:05:16.270 00:05:18.810
this book of course but but I would say

00:05:19.140 00:05:21.690
like yeah it's it's a decent book for

00:05:21.820 00:05:23.130
sure check it out I'll talk to you next

00:05:23.350 00:05:25.530
time take care
