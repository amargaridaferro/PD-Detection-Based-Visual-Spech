00:00:01.110 00:00:02.929
people often ask me what should we eat

00:00:03.810 00:00:04.940
when we have Parkinson's disease and

00:00:05.250 00:00:07.909
what is protective what can slow that

00:00:08.280 00:00:11.060
disease and what is harmful it's a

00:00:11.370 00:00:12.350
really difficult question to answer

00:00:12.870 00:00:14.690
cause jury's still out and we are not

00:00:14.940 00:00:17.359
very specific about that if there is an

00:00:18.119 00:00:19.760
intuitionist thing which can cure

00:00:20.070 00:00:22.010
Parkinson's disease or something if they

00:00:22.350 00:00:23.420
avoid then the Parkinson disease

00:00:24.140 00:00:26.900
progression could stall but still there

00:00:27.029 00:00:29.330
is a lot of evidence for things which we

00:00:29.490 00:00:31.160
can consider are helpful in patients

00:00:31.289 00:00:32.659
with parkinson's disease or their

00:00:33.360 00:00:34.970
neuroprotective in nature and then we

00:00:35.219 00:00:37.520
also know things which should be avoided

00:00:37.800 00:00:39.950
in Parkinson's disease let's start with

00:00:40.110 00:00:42.590
the stuff which which can help you now

00:00:42.660 00:00:44.779
the most important thing is flavonoids

00:00:45.480 00:00:48.529
now flavonoids are those colorful rich

00:00:49.700 00:00:51.889
fruits which are found to be

00:00:52.170 00:00:53.420
neuroprotective they can cross

00:00:53.910 00:00:55.610
blood-brain barrier and in various

00:00:56.039 00:00:57.439
studies it's found that they're good for

00:00:57.690 00:00:59.930
brain these are things like cherries

00:01:01.070 00:01:03.470
berries oranges apples so I would

00:01:03.660 00:01:06.050
suggest to have more or some of these in

00:01:06.150 00:01:08.810
your diet the other group of compounds

00:01:09.030 00:01:11.120
which you can understand can help in

00:01:11.729 00:01:13.580
Parkinson's diseases cause they are rich

00:01:13.740 00:01:16.789
in phenyl alanine now flying alanine is

00:01:17.220 00:01:19.640
needed to make dopamine so if you have a

00:01:19.950 00:01:21.590
more of that substrate that can help to

00:01:21.780 00:01:24.080
have more of dopamine in the body and

00:01:24.900 00:01:26.810
this is found in things like president

00:01:29.090 00:01:31.580
Bacon's other things like legumes

00:01:32.189 00:01:34.789
lentils chickpeas and probably having

00:01:35.100 00:01:36.980
these things when a regular basis is

00:01:37.229 00:01:39.289
really good I sometimes suggest people

00:01:39.509 00:01:43.190
to have water salt elements overnight to

00:01:43.320 00:01:45.230
be taken in morning like five to six of

00:01:45.450 00:01:47.510
them and they are really good other

00:01:47.790 00:01:49.249
thing which is found in dozens of

00:01:49.619 00:01:50.600
various studies which is neuro

00:01:50.880 00:01:53.539
protective in nature and which helps to

00:01:54.619 00:01:56.959
as to decrease the risk factor of having

00:01:57.180 00:01:59.270
Parkinson's disease is caffeine so I

00:01:59.759 00:02:02.539
believe having coffee is a good thing to

00:02:02.640 00:02:05.090
avoid Parkinson's patient Parkinson's

00:02:05.369 00:02:08.300
disease in moderation another important

00:02:08.459 00:02:11.270
thing is which is very important to

00:02:11.910 00:02:13.200
remember is that

00:02:13.360 00:02:15.720
don't take a high-protein diet when with

00:02:15.880 00:02:17.550
your medications cause it delays the

00:02:18.220 00:02:20.220
absorption and then it can affect your

00:02:20.860 00:02:22.650
Parkinson's disease so avoiding high

00:02:23.170 00:02:24.620
protein dishes diet would be a good idea

00:02:25.630 00:02:26.850
lot of Parkinson's patients have

00:02:27.280 00:02:29.400
constipation and constipation delays the

00:02:29.800 00:02:31.170
absorption of the medicines and it makes

00:02:31.330 00:02:32.640
the disease worse so avoiding

00:02:33.550 00:02:34.800
constipation by various measures like

00:02:35.590 00:02:36.960
having more water intake having a

00:02:37.480 00:02:40.020
high-fiber diet like vegetables green

00:02:40.720 00:02:42.900
vegetables and fruits and doing regular

00:02:43.420 00:02:45.540
exercise doing walking all these things

00:02:45.700 00:02:48.840
will help you another very important

00:02:49.540 00:02:52.340
thing which is seen as a curry spice

00:02:53.350 00:02:54.960
turmeric which is known as healthy in

00:02:55.270 00:02:56.910
India this is found to be

00:02:57.100 00:02:59.340
neuroprotective and it has an active

00:02:59.770 00:03:01.740
compound which is known as curcumin now

00:03:01.960 00:03:04.830
this curcumin is neuroprotective and can

00:03:05.170 00:03:06.930
cross spread brain barrier and there are

00:03:07.270 00:03:09.720
many studies in last 10 to 15 years

00:03:10.630 00:03:13.830
which have given evidence in support of

00:03:14.140 00:03:16.350
that curcumin can help in parkinson's

00:03:16.420 00:03:18.960
disease it decreases the oxidative

00:03:19.450 00:03:20.700
stress in the brain in patients with

00:03:21.280 00:03:23.490
parkinson's disease so it and it's very

00:03:23.830 00:03:25.890
easy it's healthy there's no side effect

00:03:26.020 00:03:28.110
to it and you can have it in your curry

00:03:28.450 00:03:30.420
or you can have as raw powder or a

00:03:30.940 00:03:32.940
tablet which is considered to be quite

00:03:33.870 00:03:36.840
beneficial now we have discussed things

00:03:37.150 00:03:38.880
which can definitely help in parkinson's

00:03:39.090 00:03:41.520
patients but then there are things which

00:03:42.340 00:03:43.860
might not be that good for parkinson's

00:03:43.960 00:03:46.590
patients especially too much of alcohol

00:03:47.320 00:03:49.020
definitely can't be a good thing given

00:03:49.180 00:03:51.900
that it affects brain and and then

00:03:52.900 00:03:55.140
definitely in parkinson's patients who

00:03:55.330 00:03:57.090
are already having balance issues it can

00:03:57.280 00:03:59.670
make it worse the other important thing

00:04:00.480 00:04:03.000
is which can help in parkinson's

00:04:03.100 00:04:07.170
patients is to have diet in moderation

00:04:07.600 00:04:09.480
have small diets and do regular exercise

00:04:09.700 00:04:10.950
so they can digest what they are eating

00:04:11.410 00:04:13.500
and they don't have bloating and other

00:04:14.070 00:04:16.920
things vitamin D is also an important

00:04:17.350 00:04:18.570
factor and nowadays it's being

00:04:18.910 00:04:20.190
implicated in most of the disorders

00:04:20.350 00:04:20.830
whether it

00:04:21.139 00:04:22.480
rushon where there's multiple sclerosis

00:04:23.060 00:04:24.760
where this dementia and there are

00:04:25.010 00:04:26.909
studies which has come out in support of

00:04:27.919 00:04:29.379
Parkinson's disease as well and these

00:04:29.900 00:04:31.090
studies which are epidemiological

00:04:31.550 00:04:33.340
studies they have found that patients

00:04:33.830 00:04:35.710
who are having Parkinson's disease their

00:04:36.169 00:04:38.170
vitamin D levels are quite low as

00:04:38.720 00:04:40.570
compared to normal population so I

00:04:41.210 00:04:42.550
believe there's no harm in taking some

00:04:43.190 00:04:44.230
vitamin D supplements if you are

00:04:44.389 00:04:47.050
suffering from Parkinson's disease now

00:04:47.479 00:04:49.629
there is one word of caution to what to

00:04:49.940 00:04:52.120
avoid we have talked about alcohol but

00:04:52.490 00:04:54.730
another important thing which I should

00:04:54.770 00:04:57.070
say in in the recent epidemiological

00:04:57.740 00:05:00.460
study in which they have found is skim

00:05:00.710 00:05:02.620
milk they found that people who were

00:05:03.040 00:05:06.850
drinking skim milk once a day have 39%

00:05:07.040 00:05:09.070
more chance than people who are having

00:05:10.010 00:05:13.629
milk less than one serving a week so

00:05:14.510 00:05:16.960
probably some people are very addicted

00:05:17.120 00:05:19.029
to all the milk products I would say to

00:05:19.400 00:05:20.890
decrease your intake and that probably

00:05:21.620 00:05:23.770
might be a good idea though we still

00:05:23.990 00:05:26.080
don't have a very robust evidence

00:05:26.930 00:05:30.129
against milk products so hope all these

00:05:30.530 00:05:31.870
advice helps you and if we get more

00:05:32.090 00:05:33.790
information about nutrition I will

00:05:34.280 00:05:35.200
definitely come up with a new video

00:05:36.020 00:05:38.500
thanks for watching
