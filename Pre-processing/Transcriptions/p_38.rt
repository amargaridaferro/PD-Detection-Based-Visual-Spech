00:00:05.009 00:00:07.760
my name is Jose Rosa I Parkinson's

00:00:08.840 00:00:13.910
disease welcome to my journey several

00:00:14.130 00:00:16.490
years ago I was diagnosed with

00:00:17.010 00:00:20.480
Parkinson's disease it has been to say

00:00:20.609 00:00:22.820
the least very difficult lately living

00:00:22.949 00:00:26.750
with the symptoms so I decided to do a

00:00:27.150 00:00:30.230
series of videos where I share my

00:00:30.570 00:00:35.270
struggles with you the audience as a way

00:00:35.340 00:00:37.670
to get you to understand what it is like

00:00:38.640 00:00:43.250
living with what I see now the symptoms

00:00:43.320 00:00:45.760
that I have are not typical because I

00:00:46.770 00:00:48.260
don't have the vibrating hand that most

00:00:48.860 00:00:52.040
people have my main symptom is that I

00:00:52.350 00:00:54.319
tend to shuffle my feet when I'm walking

00:00:54.600 00:00:56.799
and I lose my balance and I can't fall

00:00:57.809 00:01:00.319
this has led to me having to take a

00:01:00.600 00:01:02.450
leave of absence from my job a medical

00:01:02.579 00:01:05.750
leave and try to find a way to cope with

00:01:06.030 00:01:09.670
my symptoms while maintaining a family

00:01:10.680 00:01:13.130
it's been hard and so I'm hoping this

00:01:13.979 00:01:16.460
educates a lot of people it's

00:01:17.070 00:01:19.030
frustrating because sometimes I might be

00:01:20.040 00:01:21.200
walking down the street and because of

00:01:21.540 00:01:24.170
my gait on my walk some people might

00:01:24.210 00:01:26.330
think I'm drunk where I've been drinking

00:01:26.810 00:01:29.240
in but there's one time I was in Everett

00:01:29.549 00:01:33.289
and I was crossing the street and I fell

00:01:34.170 00:01:35.600
lost my balance my feet shuffle then I

00:01:35.850 00:01:37.760
fell and the lady cross the street I

00:01:38.009 00:01:39.499
guess she thought I was drunk she didn't

00:01:39.630 00:01:42.770
offer any help that woke me up

00:01:42.990 00:01:45.740
that totally showed me how people

00:01:46.280 00:01:48.980
perceive what I have as something really

00:01:49.229 00:01:50.569
negative well it is negative but it's

00:01:51.170 00:01:53.179
not it's not something to have control

00:01:53.990 00:01:56.740
over so anyway this is my journey of

00:01:57.750 00:02:01.219
Parkinson's and I'm hoping that it

00:02:01.740 00:02:03.850
educates if it educates one of you

00:02:04.860 00:02:08.300
probably happy so come back soft times

00:02:08.429 00:02:10.999
you can and that will post videos as

00:02:11.280 00:02:12.320
fast as I can

00:02:13.080 00:02:14.890
the videos like I said will be about me

00:02:15.900 00:02:19.100
doing things that normally I could do

00:02:19.320 00:02:23.510
without any problems but now I can't and

00:02:23.700 00:02:27.680
it's it stinks it really does think I'm

00:02:28.140 00:02:29.570
afraid to pick up my daughter Abigail

00:02:30.540 00:02:32.570
because I'm afraid of my fall and hurt

00:02:33.800 00:02:36.380
her I'm afraid to just cross the street

00:02:36.990 00:02:39.410
because I'm afraid that my feet start

00:02:39.660 00:02:42.110
shuffling I'm going to trip over myself

00:02:42.630 00:02:45.830
and fall and get run over a car noise it

00:02:46.200 00:02:49.130
sounds kind of funny but it's terrifies

00:02:52.250 00:02:56.300
me I'm hoping for not a cure cuz I don't

00:02:56.460 00:02:58.460
think I'll be cured of this thing but

00:02:58.590 00:03:02.840
I'm hoping for the ability to live with

00:03:03.000 00:03:07.340
it and have a job of employment a lot of

00:03:07.500 00:03:09.470
this seems to be mental with me I mean

00:03:09.660 00:03:12.320
because I could be walking normally then

00:03:12.450 00:03:14.300
I start thinking about it and I'm afraid

00:03:14.490 00:03:15.920
I'm gonna start shuffling my feet and

00:03:16.170 00:03:21.440
boom I start shuffling my feet it's a

00:03:21.720 00:03:25.400
lot of it is mental but I cannot control

00:03:25.530 00:03:27.440
it that's the problem I cannot control

00:03:28.459 00:03:32.330
it anyways I hope you take this journey
