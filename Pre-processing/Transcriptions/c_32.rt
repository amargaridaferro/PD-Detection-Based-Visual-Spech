about my moonstone this is this is a

00:00:57.420 00:01:03.049
typical example of a tumbled mooster and

00:01:03.270 00:01:05.270
they'll be in this color which is called

00:01:05.780 00:01:10.100

the jewelry quality of moonstone and

00:01:33.659 00:01:34.999
because my house is tore up from the

feminine stone it's a nurturing selfless

00:02:14.879 00:02:18.319
it's a stone of intuition it's a success

00:02:18.599 00:02:24.679
stone for business I wish I could catch

00:02:24.959 00:02:28.039
this it has a fire that in that that

00:02:28.519 00:02:30.500
iridescent even in these really low

00:02:30.870 00:02:32.720
grade pieces you'll catch it every once

00:02:32.819 00:02:34.039
in a while and I just I can't help

00:02:34.260 00:02:36.770
myself and just sit and flip in and that

00:02:36.989 00:02:38.240
little beam of Sun that's coming in the

00:02:39.200 00:02:41.599
window it's a stone for abundance and

00:02:42.120 00:02:47.990
love and hope for inner growth and

00:02:51.810 00:02:54.170
it's a traveler stone but not stones my

00:02:54.389 00:02:59.270
whole life so I read as a kid I was

00:02:59.609 00:03:00.800
picking up stones and I had him in my

00:03:01.049 00:03:03.559
pocket I was always you know bringing

00:03:03.750 00:03:04.699
snow to him and putting them on my

00:03:05.220 00:03:06.710
nightstand if we would go on vacation I

00:03:06.870 00:03:08.960
would pick up rocks and I would bring

00:03:09.150 00:03:10.460
home a rock from wherever we went on

00:03:11.010 00:03:20.170
vacation and Lee has picked up the same

00:03:22.099 00:03:23.689
habit because she would go on vacation

00:03:24.299 00:03:26.420
if she would go on vacation with Grandma

00:03:26.609 00:03:29.300
as a kid she would bring me a rock from

00:03:29.730 00:03:31.129
everywhere and I have a mason jar of

00:03:31.440 00:03:32.720
rocks from vacation

00:03:32.849 00:03:34.970
I don't know worthy something from the

00:03:35.190 00:03:36.409
side of the road so I'm from like my

00:03:36.750 00:03:38.360
lake or whatever and I don't know where

00:03:38.519 00:03:39.589
they're from I just know that she

00:03:39.780 00:03:43.400
brought them home to me because it it

00:03:43.769 00:03:45.140
she knew I loved rocks and it was

00:03:45.510 00:03:47.619
exciting to her to find the perfect rock

00:03:48.629 00:03:51.740
for the representation of that vacation

00:03:51.989 00:03:53.509
that she went on and it's innate I

00:03:54.329 00:04:00.399
I treasure those rocks and moonstone

00:04:01.409 00:04:06.770
like I didn't even know I was so you

00:04:06.810 00:04:07.849
know like the the florea

00:04:08.400 00:04:09.530
so talked about the fluoride her on some

00:04:09.690 00:04:11.000
of the floor it was so attracted to

00:04:11.430 00:04:13.159
fluoride because of Illinois well then

00:04:13.349 00:04:17.689
in there I guess it would be late 80s

00:04:18.659 00:04:21.349
early 90s in a neighboring town

00:04:21.989 00:04:24.290
Carbondale there was this little hippie

00:04:24.570 00:04:25.710
witchy store

00:04:26.440 00:04:27.870
and me and Lee we go down there and we

00:04:28.330 00:04:31.650
loved it and Sarah was the proprietor

00:04:32.560 00:04:38.000
and there was incense and candles and

00:04:39.010 00:04:45.000
stone formations and books tarot cards

00:04:45.340 00:04:48.120
and her Sarah's boyfriend made jewelry

00:04:48.490 00:04:50.250
and metalsmithing and wire wrapping and

00:04:50.440 00:04:51.810
she had a jewelry case of all of these

00:04:52.240 00:04:54.030
talismans that he made out of all of

00:04:54.160 00:04:58.020
these different crystals and I would

00:04:58.330 00:04:59.460
look at them and I would say oh my gosh

00:04:59.680 00:05:01.470
I'm gonna do this he was a huge

00:05:01.660 00:05:08.580
inspiration for me as far as my wire

00:05:08.920 00:05:10.770
wrapping and my jewelry making he was a

00:05:11.290 00:05:15.150
huge influence and I just because they

00:05:15.280 00:05:16.920
would be like these big beautiful silver

00:05:17.290 00:05:18.630
pieces and they would be you know wire

00:05:18.910 00:05:20.820
wrapped and have six or seven stones in

00:05:20.920 00:05:22.470
it more they would it would be this huge

00:05:23.080 00:05:24.240
pendant that would be all silver and

00:05:24.430 00:05:26.550
there would be little stones mounted you

00:05:26.710 00:05:28.200
know in it and I remember looking at I

00:05:28.420 00:05:30.060
was like oh I wanted one so bad I wanted

00:05:30.190 00:05:30.780
one so bad

00:05:31.210 00:05:33.710
and they were like 35 and 40 dollars

00:05:34.720 00:05:38.940
back in 1990 I would buy I would buy my

00:05:39.340 00:05:43.350
incense there and she had Santa would

00:05:43.960 00:05:48.300
infer to Lee and frigates it's anamur

00:05:48.880 00:05:52.530
and just all of these earth he smells

00:05:52.840 00:05:55.350
and I just loved so much and so I would

00:05:55.510 00:05:57.240
go down there and I would buy my my

00:05:57.700 00:05:59.130
incense and Lee would go with me and we

00:05:59.290 00:06:02.340
would just look at books and poke around

00:06:02.890 00:06:06.210
and it was just just this awesome little

00:06:06.580 00:06:07.890
store it'll even be like we didn't go

00:06:08.050 00:06:12.150
see Sara Sara and she would talk to us

00:06:12.850 00:06:14.850
so we would just go and visit and I

00:06:14.980 00:06:16.170
would always make sure even do it was a

00:06:16.480 00:06:18.420
dime that's all her instance was was a

00:06:18.930 00:06:21.150
dime even it was a dime I always always

00:06:21.550 00:06:22.530
bought something because I was taking up

00:06:22.690 00:06:26.970
her time and oh there's fire in this one

00:06:30.360 00:06:32.159
sidetracked so every time you bought

00:06:32.500 00:06:35.110
something she had

00:06:36.020 00:06:38.620
she had a bowl of tumbled stones so

00:06:38.780 00:06:39.790
every time you bought something she

00:06:39.889 00:06:43.500
would say take a stone as a gift and so

00:06:44.510 00:06:47.050
every time I reached in there every time

00:06:47.450 00:06:51.580
I pulled out a moonstone every time and

00:06:51.950 00:06:54.670
I still have one it's a small square one

00:06:55.190 00:06:56.710
that I keep saying that I'm gonna wrap

00:06:57.290 00:07:01.720
which I can't find and I will I found

00:07:01.880 00:07:06.790
these digging around I found my light so

00:07:07.520 00:07:09.670
every time I pulled it the mod it didn't

00:07:09.770 00:07:11.200
it didn't matter whether I closed my

00:07:11.240 00:07:13.330
eyes and drew or I reached in and drew I

00:07:14.150 00:07:18.280
picked a moonstone every time so she

00:07:18.740 00:07:20.530
started to refer to me as moonstone I

00:07:21.260 00:07:22.210
would walk in she go there's my

00:07:24.040 00:07:26.320
moonstone then she told me I was I was

00:07:26.540 00:07:34.180
quite heavy then and so she she told me

00:07:34.220 00:07:36.129
I hadn't made some reference about

00:07:36.410 00:07:40.840
weight loss or blah blah and she said

00:07:40.970 00:07:43.600
you always pick a moonstone it's a

00:07:43.820 00:07:46.450
weight loss stone and so during the

00:07:47.150 00:07:52.659
waning moon put the moonstone in your

00:07:53.660 00:08:00.760
your right hand and pass it across your

00:08:00.919 00:08:03.450
body until you get to your left hand and

00:08:04.460 00:08:06.400
you should stand in front of your mirror

00:08:06.680 00:08:11.650
naked and look at yourself so you can

00:08:12.350 00:08:13.480
visualize yourself and how you want

00:08:13.880 00:08:15.879
yourself to be and they did it it was

00:08:16.250 00:08:17.879
uncomfortable really wasn't comfortable

00:08:18.889 00:08:20.620
but I put in my right hand in the waning

00:08:20.870 00:08:25.150
moon and I started here and I looked at

00:08:25.310 00:08:30.610
myself and I envisioned like more

00:08:31.250 00:08:33.190
definition and I envisioned more

00:08:33.800 00:08:34.630
definition and I passed it

00:08:35.029 00:08:36.459
all the way down my body around my

00:08:36.740 00:08:38.019
stomach around my hips my thighs my

00:08:38.390 00:08:40.089
inner thighs to my feet and then I

00:08:40.430 00:08:42.040
brought that back up my body and across

00:08:42.080 00:08:44.380
I gave it to my left hand and and I did

00:08:44.480 00:08:46.810
the same thing just envisioning and then

00:08:46.880 00:08:48.040
I brought it back to myself and then I

00:08:48.769 00:08:52.480
was carried it with me and I did that on

00:08:52.640 00:08:54.579
the waning moon I visioned

00:08:55.089 00:09:00.490
I don't not to be skinned T but just

00:09:01.100 00:09:02.290
envisioned I didn't need to carry all

00:09:02.329 00:09:07.900
that weight so I didn't see her for

00:09:08.180 00:09:14.530
several months due to you know work you

00:09:14.630 00:09:18.220
know whatever made it finally made it

00:09:18.380 00:09:19.540
back down to Carbondale one day me and

00:09:19.730 00:09:22.030
Lea went back down and popped in and I

00:09:22.250 00:09:23.319
picked up some incense she would all

00:09:24.140 00:09:26.079
moonstone I was like hey how you doing

00:09:26.779 00:09:28.329
she said how much weight have you lost I

00:09:28.970 00:09:32.680
lost 60 pounds a little tangible here

00:09:33.529 00:09:43.150
right so was it my was it my my ritual

00:09:43.250 00:09:45.310
that I did or my thought process my

00:09:45.740 00:09:49.120
spell that I said or was it my little

00:09:49.730 00:09:50.889
tangible reminder in my pocket that

00:09:51.110 00:09:52.960
every time I went to make it unhealthy

00:09:53.600 00:09:59.650
choice food wise I remembered my

00:10:00.170 00:10:04.269
moonstone I remembered my my goal as far

00:10:04.520 00:10:08.970
as I wanted to lose some weight and and

00:10:09.980 00:10:14.130
eat healthier make healthier choices and

00:10:15.140 00:10:19.110
so she was so excited she was so excited

00:10:20.120 00:10:21.639
and then it wasn't wasn't long after

00:10:23.829 00:10:25.630
that we would go down there would be a

00:10:25.910 00:10:27.220
sign in the store that she wasn't open

00:10:27.949 00:10:30.519
but that she had changed her hours or so

00:10:30.649 00:10:32.980
on and so forth and then we lost track

00:10:33.110 00:10:35.050
of Sara we heard a rumor that she had

00:10:35.209 00:10:39.030
opened up in the little hippie town just

00:10:40.040 00:10:41.530
just south of Carbondale called makanda

00:10:42.380 00:10:43.720
we had heard she had opened up her shop

00:10:43.940 00:10:46.810
down there because Carbondale in the

00:10:46.970 00:10:50.290
late 80s early 90s was just

00:10:50.740 00:10:55.300
not ready for that form of spiritualism

00:10:56.300 00:10:58.360
that straight away from the good old

00:10:59.210 00:11:02.470
Southern Baptist to be quite honest even

00:11:02.570 00:11:04.000
though it was a great little it was a

00:11:04.190 00:11:05.290
great little hippie town it's college

00:11:05.740 00:11:07.630
town so with the college time to get a

00:11:07.850 00:11:10.090
lot of diversity in most times they

00:11:10.370 00:11:14.440
still just weren't ready and I was I was

00:11:14.930 00:11:17.800
blessed to have her in my life for that

00:11:17.990 00:11:20.410
little bit of time and still we still

00:11:20.600 00:11:24.760
talk about Sarah I got a text from Lee

00:11:25.250 00:11:27.880
just a few weeks ago and where she lives

00:11:28.160 00:11:30.850
the town that she lives in somebody's

00:11:31.070 00:11:32.530
opening up a spiritual shop downtown in

00:11:32.660 00:11:35.110
their little Main Street and she sent me

00:11:35.150 00:11:36.190
a picture of their little storefront

00:11:36.770 00:11:38.470
window with their amethyst and their

00:11:38.750 00:11:40.030
sign and she's like oh my god mom I

00:11:40.340 00:11:41.920
looked in the window and it looks like
