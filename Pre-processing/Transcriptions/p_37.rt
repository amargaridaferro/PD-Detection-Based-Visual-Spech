00:00:04.740 00:00:06.200
I wanted to go ahead and talk to you

00:00:06.240 00:00:07.460
guys about something that affects me

00:00:07.500 00:00:09.560
personally I wanted to go ahead and talk

00:00:09.600 00:00:11.420
about Parkinson's disease

00:00:11.580 00:00:13.459
now Parkinson's was first originally

00:00:13.920 00:00:16.220
described in 1817 by James Parkinson in

00:00:16.590 00:00:18.050
his essay on the shaking palsy

00:00:19.050 00:00:20.300
Parkinson's disease is one of the most

00:00:20.910 00:00:22.970
common neurologic disorders affects 10

00:00:23.429 00:00:25.700
million people in the world 1 million of

00:00:25.800 00:00:27.279
those cases are in the US and about

00:00:28.289 00:00:30.679
60,000 new cases are diagnosed each year

00:00:31.289 00:00:33.650
and about 10% of people who have

00:00:33.960 00:00:36.020
Parkinson's disease are young onset like

00:00:36.270 00:00:39.650
myself I was diagnosed at age 34 which

00:00:40.140 00:00:42.410
anything before 50 is considered early

00:00:42.690 00:00:44.210
and I had already been having symptoms

00:00:44.670 00:00:46.340
for about eight years before I got the

00:00:47.010 00:00:49.010
diagnosis I was working at an urgent

00:00:49.260 00:00:50.930
care as an x-ray tech and medical

00:00:51.390 00:00:52.640
assistants the way I noticed the tremor

00:00:53.430 00:00:56.000
was when specifically when I was doing

00:00:56.880 00:00:58.430
blood draws because I would be doing a

00:00:58.620 00:01:00.170
blood draw and I'd have the the needle

00:01:00.540 00:01:03.410
inside and as I'm trying to hold it

00:01:03.750 00:01:06.320
still I feel my body trying to rebell it

00:01:06.450 00:01:08.539
was like this sort of this sort of

00:01:09.420 00:01:10.760
agitation that was like in my hand I

00:01:10.950 00:01:13.280
would go and I'd be in there and then as

00:01:13.500 00:01:16.760
I'm holding I would noticed that my arm

00:01:17.580 00:01:22.610
would try to shake so I had access to

00:01:23.130 00:01:24.830
doctors and the doctors of course

00:01:25.110 00:01:26.030
thought hey maybe this might be a

00:01:26.460 00:01:27.590
central tremor and gave me some

00:01:27.960 00:01:30.080
propranolol a beta blocker which slows

00:01:30.270 00:01:32.690
down the heart and helps people with a

00:01:33.060 00:01:35.270
central tremor reduced their their

00:01:35.490 00:01:37.670
tremor I kept I trading up on the

00:01:38.190 00:01:40.550
propranolol increasing my dose trying to

00:01:41.159 00:01:44.300
find a therapeutic level but it never

00:01:44.610 00:01:47.030
really took the problem away I kept

00:01:47.250 00:01:49.880
trying different tactics to stop the

00:01:50.159 00:01:52.270
tremor one of the things that I noticed

00:01:53.280 00:01:54.289
was that when I would be doing a blood

00:01:54.540 00:01:57.020
draw I'd be in there and if I'm holding

00:01:57.180 00:02:00.890
it still I'm shaking okay but if I like

00:02:01.799 00:02:04.670
move my hand or something it's still

00:02:05.220 00:02:09.109
right but the minute I stop it like

00:02:09.509 00:02:10.850
starts up again

00:02:11.860 00:02:13.350
but if I'm doing something I can make it

00:02:13.600 00:02:15.660
stop so I would like try to keep doing

00:02:16.120 00:02:17.070
something while I was doing my blood

00:02:17.290 00:02:21.000
draw it was really bizarre bizarre set

00:02:21.100 00:02:22.740
of symptoms around the same time I had

00:02:22.870 00:02:23.640
also noticed that I was having

00:02:24.370 00:02:25.710
swallowing difficulty when I would eat

00:02:26.020 00:02:28.590
food I would notice that you swallow you

00:02:28.960 00:02:31.590
you manually swallow and then part of

00:02:31.720 00:02:33.750
your swallow reflex takes over and takes

00:02:33.910 00:02:37.290
it from there I would notice that my my

00:02:37.510 00:02:39.630
larynx wouldn't exactly grab the food

00:02:39.850 00:02:41.370
and pull it down it would just kind of

00:02:41.590 00:02:43.590
sit there and so I would I would swallow

00:02:43.780 00:02:45.180
again I would notice it like hit the

00:02:45.340 00:02:46.500
food and then it would all kind of have

00:02:46.600 00:02:48.120
to go down to force it down really

00:02:48.610 00:02:50.220
forceful swallowing and this was

00:02:50.410 00:02:51.510
something that was happening as long as

00:02:51.610 00:02:53.670
the tremor was so later that job ended

00:02:53.830 00:02:56.100
up cutting my bonus when I transitioned

00:02:56.590 00:02:59.550
and they ended up basically forcing me

00:02:59.680 00:03:01.650
to lead so I couldn't continue working

00:03:02.050 00:03:04.020
there lost the health insurance and then

00:03:04.060 00:03:05.310
I had to go ahead and get on state

00:03:05.560 00:03:08.160
health insurance now at the time I had a

00:03:08.380 00:03:09.870
pretty bad herniation on the right side

00:03:10.300 00:03:12.660
it took ten months to get a microdisk

00:03:13.060 00:03:15.510
acted me on my l5 s1 and that was

00:03:15.700 00:03:17.220
because I was in between insurance and

00:03:17.650 00:03:19.890
took them a while to get ortho approved

00:03:20.350 00:03:21.750
and I had to go see a primary get a

00:03:22.150 00:03:24.210
referral do a consult get a prior

00:03:24.570 00:03:27.210
authorization it was a whole mess and

00:03:27.250 00:03:29.190
that was just for the l5 s1 I was

00:03:29.410 00:03:30.810
already having problems with my gait at

00:03:31.000 00:03:31.980
that point I was already having problems

00:03:32.680 00:03:34.830
pivoting and turning and walking and I

00:03:35.050 00:03:36.810
thought this must be because of my low

00:03:37.050 00:03:39.270
back at the same time I had a herniation

00:03:39.520 00:03:42.900
in my in my neck at c3 and four had MRIs

00:03:43.120 00:03:45.000
on both I had a feeling that Parkinson's

00:03:45.970 00:03:49.050
was a possible differential diagnosis so

00:03:49.090 00:03:50.520
I kept it in the background and asked to

00:03:50.680 00:03:51.990
go to see a neurologist I went ahead and

00:03:52.150 00:03:55.620
got an MRI the MRI showed for small foci

00:03:55.959 00:03:59.010
in the subcortical region of my

00:03:59.860 00:04:01.680
prefrontal cortex flare intensity which

00:04:01.720 00:04:03.930
is pretty nonspecific so they said

00:04:04.510 00:04:06.270
essential tremors keep on the parental

00:04:06.430 00:04:08.520
wall maybe try this other one primidone

00:04:09.130 00:04:12.449
try the primidone nothing after I had

00:04:12.610 00:04:14.699
the micro diskectomy about five s1 I had

00:04:14.830 00:04:16.560
already met my partner at this point and

00:04:17.410 00:04:19.170
they were taking care of me so I went

00:04:19.239 00:04:20.640
ahead and got the next surgery to

00:04:21.489 00:04:22.590
thinking maybe this will help with the

00:04:23.050 00:04:23.620
swallowing problems

00:04:23.960 00:04:25.150
get the back surgery to help with the

00:04:25.370 00:04:27.220
gait I'll do the next surgery to help

00:04:27.710 00:04:29.200
with the swallowing and then I can

00:04:29.390 00:04:31.930
figure out what this tremor is with a

00:04:32.210 00:04:33.640
neurologist after it's all done maybe

00:04:34.130 00:04:35.470
maybe it's a pinched nerve going all the

00:04:35.570 00:04:37.120
way down and causing all these tremors

00:04:37.490 00:04:39.580
you know but that wasn't the case I had

00:04:39.740 00:04:41.560
my back surgery my leg didn't get better

00:04:41.690 00:04:44.170
I had my next surgery my swallowing

00:04:44.420 00:04:45.880
didn't get better the tremors didn't get

00:04:46.100 00:04:48.640
better in fact everything seemed to over

00:04:48.740 00:04:51.370
the next six months get a little worse

00:04:51.410 00:04:54.580
I wasn't filing for SSI for disability

00:04:54.620 00:04:56.920
and they went ahead and denied me and at

00:04:56.990 00:04:58.840
the time we had completely run out of

00:04:59.120 00:05:02.050
money and my partner was having a really

00:05:02.210 00:05:04.630
hard time at the time and had to take

00:05:04.760 00:05:05.470
care of the kids

00:05:05.810 00:05:08.230
so I went ahead and found work again I

00:05:08.510 00:05:09.820
went on Craigslist and I found work and

00:05:09.860 00:05:11.020
I told my boss look I have all these

00:05:11.210 00:05:13.030
issues I'm not sure what they are I'm

00:05:13.370 00:05:15.160
getting health care for them but in the

00:05:15.410 00:05:17.860
meantime I need some work and so I was

00:05:17.960 00:05:19.570
working three days a week 12-hour days

00:05:19.850 00:05:21.280
out in Santa Barbara I was commuting an

00:05:21.410 00:05:23.200
hour to have to work all I had was my

00:05:23.840 00:05:26.080
motorcycle so I just I just had to do it

00:05:26.360 00:05:28.510
somewhere around this time my partner

00:05:28.610 00:05:29.860
and I got really curious about our

00:05:30.350 00:05:32.500
genetics and our ancestry and so I went

00:05:32.570 00:05:34.240
ahead and did a bunch of genetic testing

00:05:34.520 00:05:36.790
and I have a bunch of family history of

00:05:37.550 00:05:38.920
Parkinson's disease my grandma has it

00:05:39.830 00:05:43.000
her mom had it and my great-grandfather

00:05:43.600 00:05:46.450
my paternal side had it as well so I was

00:05:46.880 00:05:48.100
pretty curious about that we got the

00:05:48.470 00:05:50.950
genetic testing and I didn't come up for

00:05:51.200 00:05:54.360
the genes now I find out now that of

00:05:55.370 00:05:57.310
people with Parkinson's disease only 10%

00:05:57.560 00:05:59.860
of cases can really be considered

00:06:00.080 00:06:02.530
genetic there there are associations

00:06:03.250 00:06:05.380
with environmental causes some of these

00:06:05.660 00:06:07.630
include pesticides living in a rural

00:06:08.500 00:06:10.060
environment consumption of well water

00:06:10.850 00:06:13.270
exposure to herbicides proximity to

00:06:13.940 00:06:15.670
industrial plants any exposure to any

00:06:15.920 00:06:17.890
type of pesticide herbicide insecticide

00:06:17.930 00:06:21.280
or solvent increases the risk of PD from

00:06:21.860 00:06:23.860
33 to 80 percent now interestingly

00:06:24.670 00:06:27.010
enough higher caffeine intake is

00:06:27.440 00:06:28.780
actually associated with a lower

00:06:29.540 00:06:31.180
parkinson's risk and it goes the same

00:06:31.370 00:06:34.210
with smokers but they don't know why so

00:06:34.400 00:06:35.970
what is this progressive Parkins

00:06:36.490 00:06:39.360
disease what does this all do in the

00:06:40.180 00:06:42.770
is an area called the substantia [&nbsp;__&nbsp;]

00:06:43.780 00:06:45.870
this area in Parkinson's disease gets

00:06:46.600 00:06:48.420
damaged and it doesn't release dopamine

00:06:49.390 00:06:50.190
like you used to

00:06:50.500 00:06:54.030
these are pigmented cells inside of the

00:06:54.490 00:06:56.760
substantia [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] one thing they find in

00:06:57.100 00:06:58.830
the autopsies of Parkinson's disease

00:06:58.870 00:07:02.340
patients is the presence of Lewy bodies

00:07:03.130 00:07:05.790
these are alpha synuclein proteins that

00:07:06.040 00:07:08.250
they think might cause the damage but of

00:07:08.440 00:07:10.260
course you can't test for them you can

00:07:10.390 00:07:11.840
only see it postmortem

00:07:12.850 00:07:14.820
when I got the new job as an x-ray tech

00:07:15.010 00:07:17.370
in Santa Barbara I ended up getting good

00:07:17.590 00:07:19.080
health insurance so I took the health

00:07:19.630 00:07:21.540
insurance I decided to go ahead and

00:07:22.000 00:07:24.630
pursue treatment of my tremors and the

00:07:25.030 00:07:26.370
swallowing problems again I had already

00:07:26.530 00:07:28.260
had the surgeries on my neck and back so

00:07:28.300 00:07:30.240
I knew that wasn't it so I went ahead

00:07:30.490 00:07:32.040
and got a referral for a neurologist and

00:07:32.500 00:07:34.620
then I went straight to the top of where

00:07:34.690 00:07:35.730
I could I went to the middle the

00:07:36.130 00:07:37.980
movement disorder clinic at cedars-sinai

00:07:38.770 00:07:41.430
I mentioned the DAT scan which a dot

00:07:41.800 00:07:44.580
scan is basically they inject you with a

00:07:45.660 00:07:47.160
radioisotope that's connected to

00:07:47.670 00:07:49.980
dopamine so they basically take

00:07:50.860 00:07:53.970
something that's radioactive they attach

00:07:54.160 00:07:57.840
it to dopamine it floats around attached

00:07:58.120 00:08:00.570
to the brain and the radioisotope will

00:08:00.760 00:08:03.390
give off gamma rays and then they have a

00:08:03.820 00:08:06.300
big giant machine that reads the gamma

00:08:06.580 00:08:11.010
rays and tells you if the dopamine's in

00:08:11.200 00:08:14.100
the right place or not when I had my dad

00:08:14.440 00:08:16.080
scan they noticed that the left Budiman

00:08:16.480 00:08:18.120
was losing dopamine cells which is why

00:08:18.190 00:08:20.430
the right side of my body has such

00:08:21.030 00:08:23.580
problems so the substantia [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] and the

00:08:23.890 00:08:25.920
brain those dopamine cells what do they

00:08:26.400 00:08:28.860
control obviously they control movement

00:08:29.140 00:08:31.560
and coordination as the level of

00:08:32.560 00:08:34.050
dopamine produced in the brain decreases

00:08:34.660 00:08:36.570
it leaves a person unable to move

00:08:37.169 00:08:40.530
normally so the four main criteria one

00:08:40.690 00:08:42.839
of them is not really main criteria but

00:08:43.000 00:08:47.120
it's definitely there is tremor slowness

00:08:49.450 00:08:51.510
postural instability one thing to know

00:08:51.760 00:08:53.880
is that physical symptoms are not the

00:08:54.250 00:08:54.870
only symptoms

00:08:55.150 00:08:57.660
there are also non-motor symptoms that

00:08:57.820 00:08:59.790
are very important the most recognizable

00:09:00.100 00:09:01.830
early symptom of Parkinson's is the loss

00:09:02.110 00:09:02.810
the sense of smell

00:09:03.870 00:09:05.850
constipation mood and sleep disorders

00:09:06.640 00:09:07.410
sometimes people will even get

00:09:08.110 00:09:09.300
orthostatic hypotension where they stand

00:09:09.460 00:09:12.380
up too fast and they lose their balance

00:09:13.390 00:09:14.730
although the symptoms are similar people

00:09:14.860 00:09:16.950
with you on set PD often face different

00:09:17.590 00:09:19.530
financial family and emotional concerns

00:09:20.380 00:09:21.600
so the reason why it's so hard to

00:09:22.060 00:09:23.850
diagnose is because the physician has to

00:09:24.130 00:09:26.130
take a careful neurological history and

00:09:27.070 00:09:29.190
perform an examination so there's a lot

00:09:29.230 00:09:31.200
of doctors who don't do a full physical

00:09:31.870 00:09:33.750
exam especially for neurology and the

00:09:34.060 00:09:35.820
neurological history most doctors aren't

00:09:36.070 00:09:37.350
even asking you all that they say come

00:09:37.510 00:09:38.850
in with one problem we'll deal with that

00:09:39.040 00:09:40.440
one problem in I had to shoot for a dad

00:09:40.840 00:09:43.650
scan now why was the dad skinned well

00:09:44.080 00:09:46.170
we'll just give everybody dad skins let

00:09:46.240 00:09:49.920
me tell you the dad scan is a $14,000

00:09:50.530 00:09:52.440
test I was able to get that and it

00:09:52.870 00:09:55.230
covered by insurance because I had the

00:09:55.270 00:09:56.820
best insurance I went ahead and just

00:09:57.070 00:09:58.440
bought the top one for my plan a

00:09:59.050 00:10:00.780
platinum no deductible and that was the

00:10:00.940 00:10:02.940
only reason I was able to do that but I

00:10:03.220 00:10:06.000
was paying so much every month for this

00:10:06.460 00:10:07.800
insurance that we weren't able to get a

00:10:08.110 00:10:09.720
place of our own we weren't able to

00:10:09.970 00:10:13.860
really survive I was dumping like half

00:10:14.080 00:10:15.960
the money from my job into health

00:10:16.480 00:10:17.340
insurance no sweat

00:10:17.500 00:10:18.930
so that way I could get the scans I

00:10:19.270 00:10:22.080
needed to diagnose me or rule out the

00:10:22.360 00:10:24.990
things that or a possibility very mild

00:10:25.330 00:10:27.270
cases of PD can be very difficult to

00:10:27.850 00:10:29.100
confirmed even by an experienced

00:10:29.830 00:10:31.440
neurologist that's why we don't actually

00:10:31.960 00:10:33.690
know how many cases of young onset

00:10:34.240 00:10:36.330
Parkinson's are in the u.s. or the world

00:10:36.940 00:10:38.250
there are some genetic markers but

00:10:38.740 00:10:40.470
remember genetics only take up 10% of

00:10:41.020 00:10:42.060
Parkinson's and some of those include

00:10:42.370 00:10:44.130
the pink one gene the glucose

00:10:44.740 00:10:47.820
cerebroside A's and L are our k2 gene

00:10:48.280 00:10:49.770
but genetic testing isn't done for

00:10:50.170 00:10:51.210
everybody with Parkinson's I actually

00:10:51.490 00:10:53.340
had to pay for that one on my own so

00:10:53.560 00:10:55.880
these four that I mentioned tremor

00:10:57.060 00:10:58.680
bradykinesia rigidity and postural

00:10:58.860 00:11:00.960
instability let's talk about them in the

00:11:01.089 00:11:02.590
early stages about 70

00:11:03.170 00:11:05.290
experience a tremor usually in the upper

00:11:05.930 00:11:07.660
extremity but it can be in the feet it

00:11:07.700 00:11:09.160
can be in the jaw it can be in the face

00:11:09.620 00:11:11.380
it can be in the voice the tremor

00:11:11.840 00:11:13.030
consists of a shaking or oscillating

00:11:13.460 00:11:15.460
movement as we can see here back and

00:11:15.530 00:11:18.040
forth and back and forth pill whirling

00:11:18.590 00:11:20.770
is what they call it typically the

00:11:21.110 00:11:22.480
fingers or hand will tremble when folded

00:11:22.580 00:11:24.640
in the lap or when the arm is the held

00:11:24.800 00:11:26.440
loosely at the side remember I just

00:11:27.020 00:11:28.450
mentioning intention tremor versus

00:11:29.000 00:11:30.610
resting tremor my right hand is pretty

00:11:30.890 00:11:32.530
bad my left hand is doing okay right now

00:11:33.380 00:11:37.270
if you can see my left hand is starting

00:11:37.370 00:11:43.090
to get it but it's not as bad as the

00:11:43.250 00:11:44.350
right side and that's usually the way it

00:11:44.630 00:11:46.090
goes throughout the disease usually the

00:11:46.580 00:11:48.130
affected side that starts is the worst

00:11:48.470 00:11:49.930
side throughout the entire course

00:11:50.450 00:11:52.390
now some people with PD notice that they

00:11:52.580 00:11:54.460
can stop the tremor by flexing the hand

00:11:54.770 00:11:56.740
while keeping the hand in motion that's

00:11:56.990 00:11:57.910
kind of what I was doing when I was

00:11:58.070 00:12:00.130
doing blood draws if I can do it I can

00:12:00.770 00:12:02.920
flex it really strong and like hold it

00:12:03.200 00:12:04.750
for a minute but that causes a lot of

00:12:05.180 00:12:07.660
rigidity and stiffness in my body the

00:12:07.790 00:12:10.270
other thing is I can keep it moving if I

00:12:10.520 00:12:14.440
keep my hand moving then I won't have

00:12:14.570 00:12:16.720
the tremor but when I stop that'll start

00:12:16.940 00:12:19.540
back up again bradykinesia bradykinesia

00:12:20.090 00:12:22.030
is a defining characteristic of

00:12:22.670 00:12:24.340
Parkinson's disease and it describes a

00:12:24.800 00:12:26.590
general reduction of spontaneous

00:12:26.780 00:12:28.600
movement this can give the appearance of

00:12:29.150 00:12:31.240
abnormal stiffness and decrease facial

00:12:31.660 00:12:33.160
expressivity difficulty with repetitive

00:12:33.950 00:12:36.670
movements such as finger tapping you'll

00:12:36.950 00:12:39.190
notice one side will slow down so one

00:12:39.410 00:12:40.660
thing they'll have you do is finger tap

00:12:43.510 00:12:46.570
and this one doesn't really want to do

00:12:46.700 00:12:49.480
it as much often this'll effect put

00:12:49.790 00:12:52.420
buttoning a shirt cutting food brushing

00:12:52.550 00:12:53.920
the teeth people with severe

00:12:54.350 00:12:55.960
bradykinesia and the legs often walk

00:12:56.150 00:12:58.150
with short shuffled steps there's a lot

00:12:58.310 00:13:00.220
of examples online of this so the

00:13:00.470 00:13:02.620
reduction of movement also can cause the

00:13:02.980 00:13:05.860
voice to become affected in speech and

00:13:06.160 00:13:08.110
swallowing when that's affected like in

00:13:08.270 00:13:10.480
my case the voice can become quieter

00:13:11.180 00:13:13.810
less distinct and more muddled Ridge

00:13:14.690 00:13:16.090
rigidity is exactly what you expected to

00:13:16.130 00:13:18.940
be stiffness and inflexibility usually

00:13:19.070 00:13:21.940
your arms and legs the torso and your

00:13:22.250 00:13:24.280
neck are involved in Parkinson's the

00:13:24.590 00:13:26.170
muscle tone of an affected limb is

00:13:26.690 00:13:29.050
always stiff it never relaxes this can

00:13:29.180 00:13:30.310
result in the decreased range of motion

00:13:31.190 00:13:33.520
also people with Parkinson's don't swing

00:13:33.740 00:13:35.530
their arms as much when they walk if at

00:13:35.660 00:13:38.830
all rigidity is uncomfortable and it can

00:13:38.930 00:13:41.380
be painful number four one of the most

00:13:41.900 00:13:44.830
important signs that is in Parkinson's

00:13:45.050 00:13:47.950
is the postural instability it's just a

00:13:48.410 00:13:49.870
tendency to be unstable when standing

00:13:50.150 00:13:52.270
upright a PD patient with postural

00:13:52.370 00:13:54.280
instability has lost some of the

00:13:54.860 00:13:56.020
reflexes for maintaining in a brand

00:13:56.540 00:13:58.150
posture some people develop a dangerous

00:13:58.610 00:14:00.190
tendency to sway backwards when rising

00:14:00.320 00:14:03.460
from chair standing turning pivoting

00:14:04.460 00:14:05.440
this leads me to some of the secondary

00:14:05.930 00:14:07.390
motor symptoms which include the

00:14:07.910 00:14:09.280
freezing of the gait which is another

00:14:09.770 00:14:10.900
important sign it's not exactly

00:14:11.360 00:14:12.430
explained by rigidity and it's not

00:14:12.800 00:14:14.680
exactly experian I waited kinesia but

00:14:14.930 00:14:16.720
people who experience it will normally

00:14:17.090 00:14:18.990
like hesitate before stepping forward

00:14:20.000 00:14:21.100
feeling is if their feet are glued to

00:14:21.230 00:14:24.160
the floor for me when I try to pivot my

00:14:24.380 00:14:26.020
right leg just won't come with me it

00:14:26.270 00:14:28.870
just stuck other times it's like I want

00:14:28.910 00:14:30.460
to go do something and I'll just stop

00:14:31.720 00:14:33.970
and all like freeze and I have to like

00:14:34.610 00:14:36.670
mentally get my momentum to like go over

00:14:36.770 00:14:38.770
it again often if we can get past that

00:14:39.140 00:14:41.320
first step then we're okay freezing is

00:14:41.660 00:14:43.810
usually temporary and usually everything

00:14:43.940 00:14:45.280
is okay once you can get past the

00:14:45.680 00:14:47.440
freezing point freezing can occur in

00:14:47.720 00:14:49.870
very specific situations such as when

00:14:50.270 00:14:52.030
starting to walk pivoting crossing a

00:14:52.070 00:14:53.950
threshold or doorway approaching a chair

00:14:54.350 00:14:55.330
one of the interesting things is

00:14:56.120 00:15:01.260
freezing rarely happens on stairs

00:15:02.270 00:15:03.580
micrographia is another one it's when

00:15:03.770 00:15:05.020
you're riding gets smaller and smaller

00:15:05.570 00:15:06.460
because remember how I was showing you

00:15:07.270 00:15:11.470
this and this like kind of stops it

00:15:11.780 00:15:13.210
doesn't want to do the repetitive motion

00:15:13.850 00:15:15.880
when I'm riding it's the same thing it

00:15:16.130 00:15:18.190
gets smaller and smaller and slower and

00:15:18.950 00:15:20.620
it's called micrographia so you notice

00:15:20.780 00:15:22.030
some of my writing starts out big and

00:15:22.850 00:15:24.460
it's a little bit smaller as it goes hon

00:15:25.369 00:15:27.309
drooling in excess saliva are very real

00:15:27.679 00:15:28.629
thing but it's not because you're

00:15:28.910 00:15:30.249
actually producing more saliva it's

00:15:30.529 00:15:31.869
because your swallow reflex is

00:15:32.689 00:15:33.999
disappearing another secondary motor

00:15:34.549 00:15:36.519
symptom of Parkinson's is the masked

00:15:36.829 00:15:39.129
face means a person's face might appear

00:15:39.350 00:15:41.289
less expressive than usual this is

00:15:41.660 00:15:44.169
because of reduced unconscious facial

00:15:44.629 00:15:45.729
movements now some people with

00:15:46.279 00:15:47.739
Parkinson's experience movements that

00:15:47.869 00:15:49.600
are too fast not too slow they're

00:15:49.879 00:15:52.150
especially troublesome in speech and

00:15:52.429 00:15:54.460
movement you'll notice sometimes I will

00:15:54.679 00:15:56.289
talk excessively fast it's hard to

00:15:56.689 00:15:58.210
understand sometimes I also experience

00:15:58.369 00:16:00.609
it what's called festa nation it's an

00:16:01.119 00:16:02.530
uncontrollable acceleration and gait

00:16:02.839 00:16:03.939
I'll go to do something and I'll go too

00:16:04.339 00:16:06.789
fast and then that can cause you know

00:16:07.040 00:16:08.439
risk for Falls that sort of thing so

00:16:08.839 00:16:10.689
what makes Parkinson's symptoms better

00:16:10.879 00:16:13.449
or worse medicine and treatments aside

00:16:14.209 00:16:16.079
what what can exacerbate the symptoms

00:16:17.089 00:16:17.889
and it's actually interesting because

00:16:18.459 00:16:20.739
stress positive or negative stress can

00:16:21.049 00:16:24.039
both increase the symptoms celebrations

00:16:24.799 00:16:26.079
social outings those are positive

00:16:26.869 00:16:28.299
stressors they can make your symptoms go

00:16:28.999 00:16:30.579
you know it can make your symptoms amp

00:16:30.799 00:16:31.539
up a little bit

00:16:32.029 00:16:33.879
unwelcome stresses would be like sleep

00:16:34.069 00:16:35.919
deprivation physical discomfort from the

00:16:36.290 00:16:38.909
rigidity illness conflict injury

00:16:39.919 00:16:42.369
operations stress doesn't cause PD but

00:16:42.499 00:16:44.530
it can worsen the symptoms some people

00:16:44.749 00:16:46.210
also experience a relief of their

00:16:47.169 00:16:49.030
symptoms we're talking about dopamine

00:16:49.489 00:16:51.069
here right some people when they're just

00:16:51.439 00:16:53.259
around good situations and they're happy

00:16:53.480 00:16:55.030
and their Parkinson's symptoms will go

00:16:55.220 00:16:56.439
down some and I've noticed this in

00:16:56.660 00:16:58.749
myself when I'm in a really good spot my

00:16:59.119 00:17:00.579
Parkinson's symptoms are a little bit

00:17:00.799 00:17:02.979
less and when I'm stressed the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out

00:17:03.679 00:17:05.649
my Parkinson's symptoms get pretty bad

00:17:06.169 00:17:06.970
that's one of the things that used to

00:17:07.309 00:17:08.769
happen at work all the time is I'd go to

00:17:08.990 00:17:12.309
work I I would go commute an hour and I

00:17:12.470 00:17:13.750
have to work in that I'd get to work and

00:17:13.880 00:17:16.059
then I drink a little coffee and just

00:17:16.579 00:17:18.129
having like 20 people in the waiting

00:17:18.500 00:17:20.139
room at the urgent care waiting to come

00:17:20.419 00:17:22.090
back and waiting for the front desk to

00:17:22.250 00:17:24.069
sign them in would get me so amped up

00:17:24.350 00:17:26.169
that my my symptoms would make it

00:17:26.480 00:17:28.659
impossible for me to do blood draws or

00:17:29.179 00:17:31.000
injections eventually I had to get my

00:17:31.309 00:17:33.270
neurologist to write my

00:17:34.280 00:17:37.299
my manager and let her know that this

00:17:37.520 00:17:38.890
was going on and I was just diagnosed

00:17:39.049 00:17:41.049
with Parkinson's and you know it's it's

00:17:41.360 00:17:42.850
really hard on coworkers and things like

00:17:43.010 00:17:43.720
that when you're supposed to be

00:17:44.120 00:17:45.399
self-sufficient doing your job and your

00:17:45.919 00:17:47.230
license to x-ray tech and you can't do

00:17:47.270 00:17:49.120
your job some of the non-motor symptoms

00:17:49.760 00:17:51.250
that people don't necessarily talk about

00:17:51.470 00:17:53.409
very much sleep disturbances make it

00:17:53.809 00:17:55.600
very tough to go to work the next day

00:17:55.880 00:17:57.760
when you haven't slept properly I'd have

00:17:57.890 00:17:58.870
to get up in the middle of the night to

00:17:58.970 00:18:01.539
go to the bathroom cramping in my leg

00:18:01.820 00:18:03.549
and my toe would wake me up in the

00:18:03.770 00:18:04.690
middle of the night and I'd have to jump

00:18:04.880 00:18:08.470
up excessive saliva fatigue loss of

00:18:09.070 00:18:10.930
energy some people experience depression

00:18:11.659 00:18:12.820
in fact a lot of people experience

00:18:13.240 00:18:16.149
depression vision problems dental

00:18:17.080 00:18:19.200
problems hallucinations fear and anxiety

00:18:20.210 00:18:21.340
cognitive issues such as memory

00:18:21.919 00:18:24.789
difficulties slowed thinking confusion

00:18:25.840 00:18:27.370
dementia another one that a lot of

00:18:27.620 00:18:28.930
people don't talk about is autonomic

00:18:30.039 00:18:31.649
dysfunction autonomic dysfunction

00:18:32.659 00:18:33.940
sometimes I have to speak things twice

00:18:34.340 00:18:36.850
just to get it right but autonomic

00:18:37.309 00:18:39.100
dysfunction is common impaired

00:18:39.679 00:18:41.500
intestinal motility that's the that's

00:18:41.630 00:18:42.490
the constipation

00:18:42.710 00:18:45.640
we're talking about erectile dysfunction

00:18:46.130 00:18:49.029
bladder infections a lot of people talk

00:18:49.070 00:18:51.279
about increased sweating hyper hydrosis

00:18:51.919 00:18:52.960
one of the things that causes such a

00:18:53.270 00:18:55.659
problem at night for sleeping is the

00:18:56.270 00:18:58.299
physical discomfort the stiffness the

00:18:58.640 00:19:00.820
rigidity being unable to turn over in

00:19:01.070 00:19:03.640
bed properly being restless having

00:19:04.100 00:19:06.340
painful dystonias and cramps many people

00:19:06.650 00:19:07.720
experience vivid dreams or

00:19:07.820 00:19:09.789
hallucinations and act out violent

00:19:10.210 00:19:12.279
nightmares it's a problem called REM

00:19:12.650 00:19:14.680
sleep disorder and that's one that I

00:19:15.140 00:19:17.110
suffer from greatly I'm always thrashing

00:19:17.210 00:19:18.760
around in my sleep and talking in my

00:19:18.799 00:19:21.010
sleep and there's some steps that can be

00:19:21.110 00:19:22.510
taken toward that you know stay away

00:19:22.730 00:19:24.820
from stimulants and caffeine chocolate

00:19:25.340 00:19:28.029
alcohol in the evening avoid naps limit

00:19:28.190 00:19:29.950
your fluids before bed go to the

00:19:30.559 00:19:31.299
bathroom one of the ones I mentioned

00:19:31.880 00:19:33.399
that I want to talk about that it

00:19:33.440 00:19:35.940
doesn't get a lot of attention is apathy

00:19:36.950 00:19:39.720
and apathy is it's becoming more

00:19:40.730 00:19:42.440
recognized as a common symptom

00:19:42.629 00:19:44.149
this affects 40% of people with

00:19:44.340 00:19:46.070
Parkinson's without cognitive impairment

00:19:46.369 00:19:49.849
and 60% of people with PD with cognitive

00:19:50.869 00:19:52.940
impairment apathy similar to the motor

00:19:53.249 00:19:55.159
symptoms is thought to result from a

00:19:55.409 00:19:58.070
loss of dopamine in the brain it can

00:19:58.230 00:20:00.649
develop before the PD diagnosis or any

00:20:00.989 00:20:03.859
stage during the progression also nearly

00:20:04.220 00:20:06.379
all people with Parkinson's will

00:20:06.840 00:20:08.659
experience some degree of cognitive

00:20:09.139 00:20:11.509
change difficulty finding words having

00:20:11.789 00:20:13.820
poor judgment now dementia is more

00:20:14.309 00:20:16.970
common in people who develop PD after 60

00:20:17.190 00:20:18.830
or people whose PD is characterized

00:20:18.929 00:20:21.190
primarily by slowness or bradykinesia

00:20:22.200 00:20:23.629
cognitive problems have a major impact

00:20:24.119 00:20:26.299
on quality of life engaging in mental

00:20:26.580 00:20:27.859
games and problem-solving can help

00:20:28.379 00:20:29.720
exercise the brain helps keep the brain

00:20:30.119 00:20:32.029
making new connections and helps stave

00:20:32.249 00:20:33.560
off some of these symptoms but it

00:20:33.840 00:20:35.659
doesn't stop it completely usually as a

00:20:35.940 00:20:37.519
side effect of the dopamine medication

00:20:38.399 00:20:39.889
hallucinations can be common sometimes a

00:20:40.230 00:20:41.710
person with Parkinson's will imagine

00:20:42.720 00:20:45.320
children or small animals or see a face

00:20:45.869 00:20:47.810
or have the impression of a figure I've

00:20:47.999 00:20:49.820
actually had a couple of auditory

00:20:50.609 00:20:51.799
hallucinations myself where I'm like I

00:20:52.019 00:20:53.659
heard something and I'm like that wasn't

00:20:54.029 00:20:55.310
there I know that wasn't there but I

00:20:55.379 00:20:56.989
heard it Parkinson's disease is a

00:20:57.480 00:20:59.359
clinical diagnosis there's no diagnostic

00:20:59.999 00:21:02.359
test requires your history and then a

00:21:02.580 00:21:03.739
bunch of tests to rule out some of the

00:21:03.869 00:21:05.629
other stuff the bad scan can help in the

00:21:05.909 00:21:07.729
early stages really Parkinson's comes

00:21:07.889 00:21:12.109
down to three cardinal signs resting

00:21:12.389 00:21:15.529
tremor rigidity bradykinesia like I said

00:21:15.629 00:21:16.639
the fourth one is postural instability

00:21:17.309 00:21:18.440
and that kind of goes with it a little

00:21:18.600 00:21:20.810
bit but it requires two out of the three

00:21:21.799 00:21:25.310
signs so I had resting tremor and I had

00:21:25.830 00:21:27.259
rigidity I had resting tremor and

00:21:27.509 00:21:29.090
rigidity pretty bad it was when the

00:21:29.489 00:21:30.560
bradykinesia started coming and I

00:21:30.809 00:21:32.119
started freezing and I started having

00:21:32.220 00:21:34.099
issues with slowness that's when the

00:21:34.739 00:21:35.899
diagnosis really started to become more

00:21:36.419 00:21:38.359
critical so because I had resting tremor

00:21:38.580 00:21:39.999
rigidity bradykinesia

00:21:41.009 00:21:42.950
postural instability and my dad scan

00:21:43.259 00:21:46.070
came back with loss of dopamine cells I

00:21:46.470 00:21:48.109
was able to get the diagnosis from my

00:21:48.509 00:21:50.149
doctor some of the treatments revolved

00:21:50.309 00:21:51.830
around Parkinson's disease

00:21:52.200 00:21:53.810
can cause more harm than good but it's

00:21:53.879 00:21:55.669
really just a matter of benefit versus

00:21:55.950 00:21:57.470
risk so for instance people with

00:21:58.139 00:21:59.930
levodopa it can cause Diskin eazy-e's

00:22:00.179 00:22:02.180
and things like that you see Michael J

00:22:02.220 00:22:04.039
Fox he has a lot of dyskinesia us from

00:22:04.169 00:22:06.320
his levodopa there's also deep brain

00:22:07.039 00:22:09.230
stimulation where they implant

00:22:09.809 00:22:10.879
electrodes into your brain and they give

00:22:10.980 00:22:12.499
you a controller and you can control the

00:22:12.990 00:22:14.629
stimulation I've seen people on YouTube

00:22:14.789 00:22:17.269
they turn it off and then their symptoms

00:22:17.460 00:22:18.560
come back and they turn it on their

00:22:18.809 00:22:20.930
symptoms are gone it's pretty amazing

00:22:21.179 00:22:23.869
but hey that's brain surgery and I'm not

00:22:23.970 00:22:25.730
at that point yet since there's a loss

00:22:25.889 00:22:28.070
of dopamine you can always add dopamine

00:22:28.500 00:22:30.590
agonists like Requip which is one of the

00:22:30.750 00:22:33.019
ones I was on they aim to replenish

00:22:33.720 00:22:34.730
dopamine flood the brain with dopamine

00:22:35.370 00:22:37.610
so that way you have enough so even if

00:22:37.710 00:22:39.590
you only have a few receptors going at

00:22:39.750 00:22:40.539
least there's enough dopamine

00:22:41.549 00:22:42.350
circulating to where you'll get the

00:22:42.899 00:22:43.909
amount you needed but they don't really

00:22:44.159 00:22:45.860
help long-term none of these medications

00:22:46.759 00:22:48.499
can stop the disease from progressing

00:22:49.289 00:22:51.440
they can slow it but the issue is still

00:22:51.629 00:22:53.090
there one of the most neuroprotective

00:22:53.580 00:22:55.220
things that they've noticed is exercise

00:22:55.620 00:22:57.590
and some of that falls under yoga or Tai

00:22:58.100 00:23:00.440
Chi because they encourage disciplined

00:23:01.049 00:23:02.450
movements rigorous posture and

00:23:03.149 00:23:04.549
stretching many people with PD find

00:23:05.009 00:23:07.580
exercise challenging and they might not

00:23:07.830 00:23:09.259
want to because of fear of becoming

00:23:10.039 00:23:12.289
exhausted or because of the weakness the

00:23:12.779 00:23:13.999
fatigue it's important to have a

00:23:14.519 00:23:17.029
balanced diet with people like me or

00:23:17.100 00:23:19.279
people with swallowing issues a diet of

00:23:19.559 00:23:21.710
soft foods with supplements for

00:23:22.350 00:23:24.379
nutrition is recommended some people

00:23:24.480 00:23:26.600
with levodopa find that their medication

00:23:26.909 00:23:28.039
doesn't work for them if they have a

00:23:28.259 00:23:29.509
high protein meal so they have to

00:23:29.909 00:23:30.769
stagger their meals and their

00:23:31.529 00:23:33.499
medications it's important for family

00:23:33.600 00:23:35.289
and friends to recognize the

00:23:36.299 00:23:38.629
unpredictable nature of Parkinson's stay

00:23:39.629 00:23:41.480
offer help when it's needed and you can

00:23:41.730 00:23:43.310
find the right balance between helping

00:23:43.559 00:23:46.039
and encouraging independence I did come

00:23:46.200 00:23:49.279
across some exciting research which used

00:23:49.919 00:23:53.060
stem cells to replace injured neurons as

00:23:53.340 00:23:55.700
we know stem cells are undifferentiated

00:23:56.519 00:23:59.119
cells that can develop into specialized

00:23:59.429 00:24:00.769
cells so these are cells in the body

00:24:01.080 00:24:03.019
that can turn into any type of cell

00:24:03.480 00:24:04.549
every cell in your body is a certain

00:24:04.799 00:24:06.139
type and it doesn't change I can't take

00:24:06.179 00:24:08.090
a neuron and turn it into a skin cell it

00:24:08.250 00:24:09.919
just doesn't work that way but stem cell

00:24:10.320 00:24:12.560
can turn into a skin cell or a neuro

00:24:13.320 00:24:15.259
stem cells in the embryo are pluripotent

00:24:16.169 00:24:17.210
which means that they can differentiate

00:24:17.850 00:24:19.669
into any type of cell in the body the

00:24:19.919 00:24:22.070
cells fate is determined by the chemical

00:24:22.470 00:24:25.120
signals around it from its environment

00:24:26.130 00:24:28.970
those chemical messengers can turn on

00:24:29.519 00:24:31.880
specific genes and silence others as

00:24:32.880 00:24:34.759
stem cells age they lose some of their

00:24:35.429 00:24:37.190
flexibility and then they're confined to

00:24:37.350 00:24:38.750
areas with a high demand for cell

00:24:39.000 00:24:40.730
replacement such as the skin and testin

00:24:40.889 00:24:43.759
and bone marrow in the brain stem cells

00:24:43.919 00:24:45.799
are responsible for the neurogenesis

00:24:45.990 00:24:47.389
that provides a continuous supply of

00:24:47.909 00:24:49.879
neurons in the hippocampus and olfactory

00:24:50.340 00:24:52.549
bulb by placing embryonic stem cells in

00:24:52.710 00:24:54.230
it into an adult nervous system

00:24:55.230 00:24:56.750
encourages them to differentiate into

00:24:57.029 00:24:59.360
neurons appropriate to that area they've

00:24:59.669 00:25:01.430
been used to replace dopamine-producing

00:25:01.950 00:25:04.370
neurons in the damaged basal ganglia of

00:25:04.889 00:25:08.000
rats as a result the rats recovered from

00:25:08.279 00:25:10.250
movement defects that mimicked symptoms

00:25:10.440 00:25:12.799
of Parkinson's disease in humans the

00:25:13.230 00:25:15.440
basal ganglia is also especially active

00:25:15.690 00:25:19.279
during complex sequences of movements it

00:25:19.679 00:25:20.570
appears they're involved in learning

00:25:21.029 00:25:23.690
movement sequences so the movements can

00:25:23.789 00:25:25.070
be performed as a unit one of the

00:25:25.350 00:25:27.049
symptoms of Parkinson's is impaired

00:25:27.510 00:25:28.789
learning whether motor behaviors

00:25:29.190 00:25:31.190
involved or not malfunction in the basal

00:25:31.230 00:25:32.600
ganglia results in postural

00:25:32.880 00:25:34.759
abnormalities and involuntary movements

00:25:34.889 00:25:36.320
and Parkinson's disease and Huntington's

00:25:37.830 00:25:38.960
one thing that's difficult for people

00:25:39.210 00:25:40.840
with Parkinson's who are young

00:25:41.850 00:25:44.539
especially my agent of 30s is that when

00:25:44.940 00:25:46.039
symptoms get to a point where they can't

00:25:46.169 00:25:47.960
do their job anymore we need to be able

00:25:48.120 00:25:50.840
to allow them to stop working and focus

00:25:51.080 00:25:53.600
on treating their condition and trying

00:25:53.700 00:25:54.860
to get their symptoms better

00:25:55.230 00:25:56.649
I've been denied for federal disability

00:25:57.659 00:25:59.690
over and over and over again

00:26:00.419 00:26:02.180
currently I am creating videos trying to

00:26:02.519 00:26:03.830
bring education to people while I'm

00:26:04.080 00:26:05.779
still on state disability I still help

00:26:05.940 00:26:08.330
out around the house when I can I don't

00:26:08.580 00:26:11.090
work right now but that may change I may

00:26:11.309 00:26:12.470
have to find some work

00:26:12.510 00:26:14.000
I may have Parkinson's but I'm still

00:26:14.159 00:26:14.840
trying to make video

00:26:15.120 00:26:17.180
and educate people one of the things I

00:26:17.340 00:26:18.860
want to leave you with with Parkinson's

00:26:18.929 00:26:20.840
disease you will usually die with

00:26:21.539 00:26:23.629
Parkinson's disease not of Parkinson's

00:26:24.029 00:26:26.379
disease so there is some hope

00:26:27.389 00:26:29.049
exercise talking to your neurologist

00:26:30.059 00:26:31.730
exploring treatment options you can

00:26:32.070 00:26:34.909
still live a satisfactory life if you

00:26:35.190 00:26:37.789
have family and friends teach them more

00:26:37.830 00:26:38.419
about it

00:26:38.519 00:26:39.830
so that way they know how to support you

00:26:39.990 00:26:42.049
and be there for you when times are
